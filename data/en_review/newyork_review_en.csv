0,0,Flushing­Main Street,3.8,"Too crowded and messy place/parking is difficult and unable to meet \ n in a word \ n is complicated ~/Complex ..There are few seats in major restaurants such as Bucks, McDonald's, and Papis.The tremendous amount of saliva or tissue is on the ground, so it can reach the wheel or floor of the cart depending on how close the bag of baggage is on the ground.It is best not to do it. Most of the Chinese people I met were kind, but there were a few Chinese people who were rude and racist.The Flushing Library was doing it with me as if a Chinese guard was a dog.And the library has been open for 10 minutes, and employees can really be a ghetto regardless of race. They like to be chased and noisy in the library.The market can use the money to pay a luxurious vacation cost for yourself and the employee. If possible, go out from New York. \ N \It is Booth Memorial Ave. It is a very quiet peaceful neighborhood. There was a Western beef that was closed nearby, and it seems to be because it was more American and residents. ""I'm trying to make it, but it's hard to fix something that's been over 100 years, but it's still reliable, but it's not really different.It is a great place to share with friends because it has a variety of cultures and various kinds of foods, such as subway and buses.It is the terminal of train 7.Seven local trains always run to the station.급행 열차 7대가 주중 출퇴근 시간 동안 운행하며 정차역은 다음과 같습니다: Flushing-Main St, Mets Willets Pt, Junction Blvd, Woodside-61 St, Queensboro Plz 및 Queensboro Plz 서쪽의 모든 정류장.\n\n급행열차는During the weekday commute time, it runs only on M and 2.Local trains can only run on Track 1 outside of commute time.The rate control station can be found at the east end of Roosevelt AV or at the intersection of Roosevelt AV and Main St.Two fare control areas are not connected to each other.The metrocard machine in the central center is easy to malfunction, while the machine at the east end of the station is in good condition.Elevators and escalators are located at the east end of the station.The entrance of the central two -layer is easy to crow.Currently, construction and renovation are in progress to reduce the congestion of the station. \ N \ nmta bus can be transferred and connected: Q12, Q13, Q15, Q15A, Q16, Q17, Q19, Q20a/B, Q25, Q26, Q27, Q28, Q34, Q48, Q58, Q65 and Q66;MTA Limited Bus: Q17 LTD, Q25 LTD, Q27 LTD, Q50 LTD, Q58 LTD and Q65 LTD MTA selection bus service Q44SBS;N20g of NICE bus;And to the Fortwashington branch of LIRR.Few people speak English on the road.99%of them are Chinese.Flushing's supermarket is all in Chinese, and most of them are Chinese.It is very convenient to live in Chinese because it is almost indicated in English.But Flushing is dominated by Chinese people, so environmental hygiene is not very good.Basically, the characteristic of flushing is dirty and messy.If you walk, the New York police can't crack down and you can do it.Anyway, Americans rarely go there.But I remember that there were so many people.The same is true now.Except this time.There were so many people anxious and some did not wear a mask.Anxiety overload/""Very rude employee.

Otherwise, it takes about 30 minutes by express in the peak time.See the red arrow to the train and tell me whether the weather is usually a train or express train.Especially in a hurry, it is very useful.Look a little ahead ./ The main street is the main street.I think I need a book to explain the taste properly.Many people pass by relatively quietly.The bathroom is usually open.It is safe even at night./ It would be nice to extend the train from Roosevelt Avenue, 149th ST, and 11th AV to College Point Blvd.More than 10 people were waiting in line to use the machine.Excellent service.The middle floor is wide and crowded during commute.A sign that guides you to the required bus transfer place.There are many bus routes.Every morning, the train to Flushing is so delayed that it may take 10 to 15 minutes to move from the Mets/Willet branch to the main street station.The booth staff are really rude and screaming at the customer for no reason.They clearly have no educational background.""Why do I need to help you and treat you like you?!""lol.This is the appearance of our MTA employees ....

remaining parts of the skyline before covering the last free space with a monster -like high -rise building.There are a few commercial facilities inside the station, and there are other commercial facilities such as Baf Shop, Restaurant, and Bodega.As a MTA hub, it seems to show exactly what priorities are.Manhattan.In many cases, the NYC trains are often sacrificed to Queenz.This is the only positive thing about Qbp.Does the police do nothing and watch people run around and smoke and hang their thumbs on their total belts?It is a joke/large outdoor double platform.Enter through the bridge

large traffic hub for all trains.Overall, it's quite ordinary, and it gets a little cold in winter.E, M, R trains operate.Weekly services are not generally disturbed, but weekend services sometimes change.Check out the signs because some trains do not operate on certain lines.Also, if you get off the train here, it can be very difficult to go to the desired exit.Prepare!/The platform requires

station.Do not confuse Queensboro Plaza and Queens Plaza.Trains, destinations and different functions are different places.N/W is easily transferred to 7th across the platform when heading to Manhattan.If you need to switch again, use the stairs.Sometimes there are times when the train is not operated, so you need to take a shuttle on the street.The bus is not right below ... just follow the crowd.From here, you can take one stop to G and access Brooklyn without leaving Manhattan.It can only be used after 18 minutes after running.It's a pity ./ I always had a bad experience in this

arrives, the stress will be relieved to some extent.This valuable space can be easily rewarded with a train vehicle that will soon be filled.Where should I do it?I only talk about the top level and the rest is a secret.Good luck!Movement between N/W and 7 is very easy across the platform.Remember that the direction of each floor is the same.The bottom is Manhattan row and the top is Queen's row./ I like Queens Boro Plaza.I hope N and W will run more often.. \ n \ n There are the north exit and the south exit, and the overpass is very similar, so the exit is wrong.The two stations are

The upper floor is for the Queen's train, and the lower floor is for the Manhattan train.There is an overpass. It does not comply with the ADA and usually has garbage at the top level.It is the only New York City subway station.

It is three years after the R188 vehicle was assigned in 7. It is also close to Queens Plaza but no free transfer.If this lacks, it will cause confusion.It can be really cold in winter, but in summer, it tends to provide a beautiful sunny view.The only way that requires some modifications is:Schedule adjustment between the Broadway line (N, W) and the 7th line.Can I reduce the overcrowding of this station if it is connected to a nearby Queens Plaza station with a small number of passengers?Perhaps ..?/Unfortunately, homeless people are sleeping across the seat and have a smell of urine.

21,21,34th Street­Hudson Yards,4.5,"The subway station opened with the opening of Hudson Yards.It is a subway station in Manhattan in 25 years.IT is a subway station in manhattan in 25 years./ Very close to Vessel, this station is quite new compared to other subway stations.It is one of the coolest products with the new design.The platform is clean and has a lot of design.The long escalator is the highlight of this station and the lighting is good.It's so clean and shiny.It also feels so future -oriented.I hope it will be updated like this.It is one of the most crowded lines that come and often come.The station is clean and there is a NYPD nearby.It is also fun to take a picture of people who go up and down with the camera parallel to the escalator.They seem to be inclined forward or back.Grandmen like this picture./ The building is really amazing.You can buy a ticket on the page or stand in line in the building. \ N enjoy a picture that you can get by taking a good camera., Please refer to it. \ N did well/as a picture of New York, beautiful and modern subway lines/This person is aggressive.He threatened to hit you and do something lewd to the person sitting opposite.As a result, we reported to the police in the finals.She came and saw him and immediately started wearing a jacket and did not admit anything.The police turned around and left.This man also stayed in it while the train was moving.Perhaps it will be very clean because it is not as much traffic as other central herbal stations.In most cases, there are MTA staff in the booth.Except for distance elevators.The outside is dirty and the interior is used as a urinal.The longest of the escalators I have seen.Very clean and bright lighting. \ N The highline is nearby.It is deep underground, so when the elevator and escalator go out, you will be hiking immediately.The modern glass exterior and the works of art on the ceiling of the escalator are very beautiful and colorful.The train has arrived on time/New York is pretty good compared to other subway stations in New York.There is a nice ceiling picture in the lobby.It is modern and clean, and I have the longest escalator I've been riding so far!Located on Line 7, it is connected to major stations such as Times Square and Grand Central.This is the best station to explore Hudson Yard (The Edge, Vessel, etc.) and highline!/I like this station so much.The only problem I am in this place is that the waiting time can be long (sometimes) and one of the most common places I don't like in NYC.This is the most fun thing you will experience in a dystopian nightmare that Hudson Yards is abandoned.It looks like it is.The tile work is beautiful, and the new New York is progressing.The new subway stations have been built in the last two years, and are basically the latest facilities, and the decorative style is very modern.Compared to other subway stations, you can definitely feel the difference.However, as you can see, this escalator is very long and very high, so if you have high phobia, you may be uncomfortable.Close your eyes and try it! \ N7 is very convenient for the last stop of the line, and three stops to the Times Square, the Grand Central Station, and the other ends are famous flushing.I recommend you to try it.If you do not have a subway card, you can buy $ 3 a one -way one -way, and if you add $ 1 to the charging amount, you only pay $ 2.75.If you are traveling, you can also buy a 3 or 7 days pass.Even monthly passes, the MTA's subway and bus service can be used for free depending on the period of stay in New York.During that period, it is still very cost -effective and economical. \ N When using the subway time zone, it is the same as the tonsil subway fee, and can be transferred to the bus from the bus and the bus to the subway.However, transfer is free.Once you get off the subway, it's not free to enter the subway, so please be careful if you are transferring.Thank you for your support!It was a great experience, but it was a great experience.It was very easy to rush and come out of the station.It is very centered on the ground./ Clean Station.If you take an escalator, it can cause dizziness for some people, so make sure that long escalators (if you don't ride an elevator) are okay.The only problem in the IS station is about train 7, which runs the station.It is also convenient and another charm for walking with children.View is free.Here you can spend all day and visit here four times. //34 -Hudson Yards is the New York City subway station in Manhattan West Side on the IRT flushing line.Opened on September 13, 2015, this station is the first subway expansion work that has been paid in the city in more than 60 years!The station is modern, clean, and unique!/It's one of the latest stations I've seen and I recommend it a lot.It would be nice if it was updated in real time.Other than that, the station close to work is really good!/It's one of my favorite subway stations in Manhattan!If you go down the long altitude, the lights are so bright that it feels like a space station!/This subway station is really beautiful from outside.But the interior is the same as other subway stations.Vassel, The SHED, The Shops, The Edge, and Skyline are here.there is.There is a huge steep escalator.It was like a slow roller coaster and I was waiting for death.It is not for those with high phobia, but I like the design of the subway station.It's never crowded or full like Times Square, but there are many people.This station is located near the train station dock, and I think that such a large terminal is not suitable for a single 7 train, so there should be more trains passing through this station.Overall, if you go up and down a few times, you'll get used to steep escalators.It is a new and clean station.The controlled environment is very helpful for cold and hot days.Since the opening of Hudson yards, this station has a convenient move to the store and park.The inclined elevator is the only thing in the system (as of 2020) because it is the most interesting.The new station means that the wanderer does not get rid of or that the famous NYC subway urine odor.All are new and clean.Because of the deep inside, there is a tremendous long escalator passage.Go back and look down and look down.I was surprised to see the mops on the train.Overall, this is one of the best stations in the city.In addition, it has a modern design.To get on the train, you have to take a long escalator, which is the only disadvantage.There is much more space to walk and much deeper underground.I hope that the escalator will be used continuously.And over time, the area is likely to be active due to new construction.This station is connected to the deep underground and can be moved to the long escalator.Because it is new, it has a minimalist appearance that contains very clean and breathable air.The lighting is also very good./ The best subway station!It's a bit unfair but still amazing because it's a new station and all the other stations are quite old.A wonderful station that is constantly being cleaned, and seriously, if you go there at any time, someone will clean it.West side and Chelsea have been greatly improved.Take 7 and go to Queens, Port Authority or Grand Central.There is always a delay, and the staff does not tell the cause of the delay.There are cameras, PA systems, and the Internet, but we cannot continue to provide information.Do not remove homeless people from the train to make it safer.And the guards of the window show their attitudes because you ask questions.This represents the huge cities of modern transportation hubs that represent the world's capital.If I can go to this station alone, it will be a welcome experience (except for some different stations).At this time, the facilities are clean, easy to pass and enjoy it.You can connect to all routes. \ N \ n This station is a state -of -the -art station, and according to my experience, there is always a train waiting for departure.There is not so many people now.It is clear that there is a very large plan for the area, and the MTA ensures that it can accommodate the future crowds.Unlike the bathroom tiles, it looks very modern and clean because of the beautifully designed murals decoded on the wall.Do not misunderstand.There is nothing opposite to classical construction, but it feels like the entire bathroom tile installation work that has been in progress for decades is in a huge toilet.7, which ends here, is only hopeful of the crowds that will be flocked to the surrounding development area./ This is a new station (relatively) with modern buildings, but if you look closely, you can wear signs and maintenance defects (eg escalator ceiling)). \ N \ n and exaggerated escalator.That's right.It's long, but it's long, but go to the DC subway and see what the deep subway station looks like.Oh, and the DC subway station is much older, but it looks more new and the management is better.They are definitely doing something right.The MTA seems to never be found.I don't like it.The escalator is steep and long.It is unimaginable to climb up and down the stairs.You can easily walk to Hudson Yards and Javits Convention Center.Very good station.It's very perfect./Beautiful station with one of the longest escalators in the world.It is very new and very convenient for the extra west and the Javits Center.Also, for those who need it, you can access the disabled by using an escalator and elevator.It is also a wonderful ending station where you can line up to the end.Besides, 7 is a great thing in the city, you can go anywhere and connect with everything.This is a quick way to attend the event of the Javits Center.The station is modern and the park on it is wonderful.The worst part is a long escalator that runs from the track to the distance./ This station, built for the future high -rise building community around 34th and 11th Street, is a modern added station to the MTA subway system.The huge front door is in a dead end, and there is an elevator.(The entire station comply with ADA.) The upper mezzanine has a toilet, the lower mezzanine has a lot of space, and there is a display on the wall.As with expectations for future crowds, the platform level is very wide.The whole station is also bright.(The only reason for the four stars is that leaks have been reported around the station ... but it is expected to be because the station was built near the river.)The last station of the route .../Amazing subway station.This is a good way to go west.The Jarvis Center is on the corner and offers a breathtaking view of the highline.A must -see attraction.If you are in Grand Central or Time Square, take 7 here.I was a little surprised by the big escalator.It is interesting to ride a long and deep escalator.The depth is 109 feet.It is also interesting that the elevator in the station is also inclined.Please check if you are on your own.You can use the convention center and the new HUDSON YARDS area under construction.ㅋㅋㅋ It was fun to surf the subway by riding the trains 7 times from Hudson Yard 34.In fact, it's really a good breeze/Thanks to this new station, it's very close to the Megabus platform.There is also a new station, and the station premises are kept clean, and even many works of art are available.The escalator is quite long, but you can sit comfortably and ride comfortably.One of the most popular places is the Highline Park, which is currently extending to 34th Street. \ N \ nIt provides a great view.Including straight.Wow!There is only one block away from the Jacob Javis Convention Center and Highline Park.The Hudson River and New Jersey's prospects are so beautiful.A must -visit place.I've been to the bus stop for the first time.I met MTA Chairman Andy byford.I went into the classic city bus.The classic bus had leather seats.I also went into a new two -car bus that adds a WiFi charger.They change the color in front of the city bus.There are dark blue, sky blue, yellow, and sky blue.I like a new MTA bus with two WiFi chargers like a snake.It is the best vehicle for the MTA bus.I want to go to another bus stop in the future.But there is no signal for the next train.There is no police officer who can help the platform ./34 Street-Hudson Yard Subway Station is one of the most future-oriented buildings in the Manhattan subway system in New York.So if you are going to Hudson Yard, take a train from Midtown to experience this wonderful ride and destination. \ N \ n #crossstownmanhattan #no7subway #NEWYORKCITY #ArtIntransitIt has the most cool street entrance among NYC subway stops.This is a big victory for us who visit the Javits Center.The javits center entrance is 2 blocks away.Useful Tips: The last car of the train is closer to the entrance to the Javits Center.Unfortunately, there are no signs to help find the best exit in the track level.Last stop.Retro Mirae. Use this station to visit the retro future./vessel or Hudson Yards./ New York City is a very wonderful and new subway station in New York City.Usually clean and good.The only problem is that the mobile phone signal is not serviced.The escalator of this subway station is very long.I've never experienced it until this time.BM1 and BM3 buses are not reliable at all after 8 pm.Returning to Brooklyn.I waited for a long time for the bus to come down from the 5th Street, and I had to take a train back to my home very late around 9:45 pm.They were supposed to come in 8:12 8:36 9:12 9:32, but no one came.It looks like you came from another city, but when the train arrives late and becomes dirty, you realize that it is still New York.It's quite deep underground, so be prepared for long escalators and long rows/crowds that use it.Otherwise, it's not noticeable.From shopping to a new tower that dominates the skyline, this new area of Manhattan really surpasses itself!Especially the works and murals are really beautiful.The stairs are steep but are escalators, so be careful.There is an elevator for the disabled.In addition, as of 2017, many constructions are underway.There is almost no long escalator, and the end is also required.Is there an elevator for the disabled?Hudson yard is already a new city center in New York.Several office practical high -rise buildings have been built, and the highline park has increased the spot due to The SHED Cultural Complex and several new restaurants./ New York has a very clean and future -oriented design.Especially the mosaic at the entrance.Similar to the Canary Wharf Subway Station in London./ Very modern and clean subway!There are a few wonderful mosaics.I went to this station and rode it several times when I went back home on the express train/This is the best subway station in New York City.It's so clean and new, so it's the best ever./Clean and good station ..
