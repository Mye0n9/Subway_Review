go fast because it was only going back to the original village, but it seems to have been quarreled with a new village name.It was rising.The towing is weak, and it seems to have originally wrote Yemada, and it has been towed.The origin of the name is due to the learning of the Shinkawaki -shi lecture.The riverside was called Hitomata village, the road that pulls the luggage to the river bank from the surrounding village, or the Hikari Gardo, so the name value becomes stomach.The prefecture, who is nervous in this village's name, was called ""Hago"" to investigate and discover ancient documents that it would be convinced if the prefecture's management was an old name.Yangchon has a merger if it is a historic name, but later found that it is a name that is not involved in the

have a Silla army, but in Japan, Silla can only be read.For this reason, it is said that the place where the military officials was prepared by using the party called the Shira Cookie was made from the winner.It seems to have been in Shiraco in Wakoshi, and later it seems that the village name has changed round every time a new merger or separation is repeated.Convenient to move to Tokyo.There

worshipers was an indispensable place to increase the number of railroad passengers.There is no such thing as attracting.In addition, the village (at that time Shikura), which was thriving as a learning of the Shinga City, was an unexpected time.It was said that it was a village where the city of Ishitada was a very falling village, and because the learning began to become a harm, it was threatened when the railroad was completed, and when it became a change of Hanchon, the road was contrary.This person's commandment seems to be called Higashigami Higashigami, but is this commandment

Marui around the station building.Tachina is bad.It is very convenient. \ N It is recommended to live because it is crowded with many commercial facilities outside the station.Even if it rains in Marui, you can go without an umbrella.The opposite Rotary is under construction, but I don't care so much.The disadvantage is that the toilet is far away.Shiki Station is said to be the most in the station where there is no transfer.There are many high schools and universities around them, and students stand out.I often go shopping and meals in Ginza, and I am going to Yokohama and go to Yokohama 2-3 times in Kamakura.There seems to be a growing number of tourists in Kawago, and I think many people are thinking about the excavation of the underground main field around the surrounding area.Higashiguchi is neatly maintained around the Marui Family.It is faithful.It is a very convenient station that is used without complaints.It's a bit sorry for Tsutaya's disappearance, and I hope

I am especially convenient or uncomfortable for me. Sometimes I look at the changes of the times, and it was not a temporary work, especially the place I was interested in. \ NStarting from the station, I wanted to solve the question of the past when I found a connection because of the focus of interest in Asaka Station and North Asaka Station. \ N \ nI think Dai Station is high, but according to the evaluation of the road railroad, it seems that at this point, it seems to be prioritizing Asaka Station.Regarding the relationship with the national railway (Japan National Railway) surrounding the route, it was written in word of mouth of North Asaka Station, so if you are interested, please read it. \ N \ nThe Sies' opinion and the results of the results were noticeable.Destructions are being given. \ N It is said to continue to pay for this, and the Tobudojo Improvement Countermeasures Council, which is composed of 7 o'clock of the Dobu Dodgeon Line.Since the station is in the designated area of the arson area in urban planning, when the elevator or home door is installed, it is necessary to be able to meet the structure and material of history to the current arson standards.It seems that it is difficult to install a home door, but it seems that we are planning a full remodeling of history from the road railroads.It seems to be. \ N \ n If you look at the HP on the Home Door, the HP on the Home doors is in progress, and until the end of 2020 (2021/03/31)According to the January 8, 2020, Asaka Station is starting from March 14, 2020, with 1 and 2 homes.Since the shooting economy of the Tokyo Olympics is done at the Athletic Self -Defense Forces Training Center, it seemed to be renewing Asaka Station, one of the nearest stations.They seemed to have been planned sequentially since the Tokyo Olympics were held in 2013.In the 1964 Olympics, the shooting game would have been held at the Athletic Self -Defense Forces Asaka Training Center.I remember faintly. \ N \ n The installation of home doors, according to the final plan at the current stage, is said to be installed in Ike Bukuro Station and Wakoshi Station, but Ikebukuro ~ Sigi, Fujimino, Kamiu Kuoka Station, Kagogoe StationThis is scheduled. \ NI don't know when.At that time, history can also be rebuilt. \ N The relationship with the station of North Musashino Sun North Korea is likely to be answered at that time. \ N \ n?I knew it, and it became clean in its own way.

Also, JR Musashi Line (Kei Nabashi ~ Beach Makuhari, Nakihu Navashi ~ Tokyo) and Mutual File, Mosashino Lake [Omiya ~ Hachi Oji]It is also a transit station. \ N \ n Dobu Dodo Line is Tokyo Metro Yuraku Cho Line, Fukuto Fresh, Tokyu Toyoko Line, Minato Miri Line, Tokyu Sinyokohama Line, Sotetsu LineTetsu Izumi route) and direct direct driving, and indirectly driving with Seibu Yuraku, Seibu Ikebukuro Line.There is a transportation network that is said to go to China.It is a transit station of the JR Musashino Line.The home is 2 sides in the connection station with the rapid express.It is the station of Joseon. \ N The station of Musashino is a little different from North Asaka Station, but it is next to \ n and there is no inconvenience to transfer.Although it is different, it is adjacent to North Korea's Kasumi Station, so it is possible to transfer with the JR Musashino line.One of the main stations of the Dobu Dogsonjo is stopped by TJ Liner, a paid seat designated train.The facilities around the station are also faithful to the convenience.Although it was a jurgey railroad of the diesel, the route to Dobu was via Asakadai.I think the transfer on the Musashino line is okay with 4 minutes.There was a rarely picture of the overpass on the station.It is a station of the JRS that is adjacent to JR North Korea Kasumi Station. \ N There is a small Rotary and restaurants in front of the station, especially if there is no impression, but if you are a little away from the station, it is a pleasant place where the roadside road continues. \ NIf you walk to the east, you can see that it is downhill, and you can see that it is an ancient station.\ NJR Musashino Station with North Asaka Station is a transit station.I only wanted to increase the number of passengers by hand. \ N The next year of opening the Bukjo Kasumi station in the Musashi Line was installed.There is no elevator.I was surprised that there was this station now. \ N I told the stationary stroller, ""Is this station no elevator?""I was stupid and hurried, and I was afraid of each child at a distance and dropped the stairs.I felt bad because of the station.I don't think it is used again.When Wolyeong has a small child, I think it's a transfer of transfer by yourself.Can't walk a little more and improve the transfer path?Especially JR.Anyway, it won't be brighter?It was to transfer and transfer. \ N If so, I think the same station was good.This is here when you come to Dobu Dodgeon.There are bookstores, tories, and Kentucky on the station.However, in the morning and

those who have a stroller because there is no, and it is an unkind production.There is also a bus in Rotary.There are many restaurants in the chain store around the station, so it is very convenient.There are three stores around the station (Olympic, Dobu Store, Miraberu) around the station./ First of all, there is no elevator.There is no elevator when you go to the stairs as it is.Because of this, you can retain or forced dangerous movements to escalators.Nowadays, I think that this is a rare case that we do not respond to this, but it is rare.I really hate this role..I feel very uncomfortable.Asaka Station next to the station is faithful to the station of the station.It is connected to the Musashino Sun North Jose Kasumi Station.. \ N Recently, it has become a convenient station for Asaka Station on the side.The North Asaka Station on the JR Musashino Line is transferred directly from the Dang Station.Train species other than the TJ liner and the speed of speed are stopped. \ N ※ This is a stop station of Kawa -Gogo, which was newly established with the amendment of the March 2019 (2019) diary.Kawago's express is not stopped to the end of Ikebukuro

trains are on the Tokyo Metro Yuraku first and bankruptcy from Wakoshi Station.You can also see Tokyo Metro Vehicle and Tokyu Train Vehicle.Dodgeon is the third largest after Ike Bukuro Station and Wakoshi Station.In the entire road, Ike Bukuro Station, Wako -shi Station, and other Senju are the fourth scale.I think that home doors will be installed in the future.The transfer time is about 4 minutes in a hurry.The shops are focusing on the stations and the premises rather than Ekinaka.Previously, there was a regular ticket store, but abolished.Asaka Station was a station near the Olympic shooting range, so it was a nicely home door (although it was meaningless because it was a non -service guest).At least I want to install a home door or install it in terms of safety.It was an uncomfortable but soft station.There are no stairs and escalators, elevators nor slopes.The expresses are also stopped at the station of transit station/Dobu Dojo with Dodo Dojo, JR Musashi Line, and

Railroad was April 15 in 1915 (Dai Show 4 years).The Youngdan subway was January 20, 1954 (Showa 29).It was a bit complex because Ikebukuro Station is a bit complex because it is composed of the

smoked specifications and a very full -hearted ride, so one of the content you want to actively want to go to the rich department is enough!!/Seibu Ike Bukuro Station was boarded at the express. \ n The groove of the train has a dedicated groove for the express train, so the purchase of the express pass was very smooth. \ NEven if the seats are also comfortably, the legs are comfortable, so the

Shinjuku Line and the bankruptcy line is severe.Why is the flow of people so bad?I always think scary.There is only one exit of Shinjuku Line.There are few ticket gates.The bankruptcy is divided into eight cars or a female occupied vehicle.The worst is that there are too many stops to the New Juku Sancho.It requires improvement.The building on the ground is in the basement, so the Marui main building, the big road, and the Isetan can go without wet.Shinjuku Subnad is also directly connected. \ N There is a one -way rules during the commuter time, and the transfers of Marunuchi and the Buddhist line are transferred outside the ticket gate.It's very crowded, so it's good to avoid people who are not familiar with the commuter time. \ NOn the contrary, if you deal with the underground passage well, you can go shortcuts.The transit is so bad that the rush of the rush is bad enough to think that it could not be considered in the construction of the bankruptcy.The station itself is

It's a lot of people.The way to Yokohama/The distance of young people who don't have to say.Shibuya ~~ ^^/It looks like a place where people live/jackpot/shopping/gangdong/Shibuya/Saikyo line.Today I used Shinnam -gu for the first time, and if I was walking to the end of the home, I had an eco corner.The plant corner named 0 is the same as response to echo activities.It's nice to have a little dusty place in the daily life without caring.I'm wandering. \ N I think it's a popular tourist destination for foreigners, but I think it's a little unkind village.However, it is also a pleasant street because there are various shops./In order to secure the height of the ceiling of the east -west free passage under the track of Shibuya Station on November 18 (Sat) and 19th (Sun)Improved construction was done to increase the tracks and grooves of the Te ship.On the 18th, Osaki (Osaki → Shibuya → Shinjuku → Ike Bukuro) all day long.On the 19th, my rotation (Ikebukuro → Shinjuku → Shibuya → Osaki) was lucky all day. \ N On the 19th, we filmed the station improvement work of the Yamanote Line 2 home (my rotation) from the Home Line 3rd Line of Shibuya Station.The Saikyo line home marriage is very noisy.I was able to see the historical construction of Shibuya Station.Because of the large and high difference between the N station itself, it takes a lot of time to transfer, but it is a convenient station.The color of the vehicle was `` Salmon Pink '', ""Blue Green"", ""Ivory White"", ""Violet"", ""Light Green"", ""Orange Beige"", ""Light Blue"" and ""Rainbow"" with special lapping.The collar of the vehicle was able to complete it as seven colors.Shopping, food, attention, and cultural facilities are gathered around the station, and it is always known as a source of young culture, and the Shibuya scrambled intersection is famous in the world.Deposit, convenient access to all over the city.JR Yamanote, Tokyu Toyoko Line, and Tokyo Metro Ginza Line intersect, so there are abundant choices.You can enjoy 24 hours.Shibuya Station is a place where Japan's charm and energy gathers, and you can say that it is worth it.Near this station, there are famous Shibuya Intersection and Hachiko Memorial Statue.There are also loyal dogs and exits.Many, Udaga and Machi Kamakuma's imported record store CISCO or Jazz Cafe Swing/Rock Cafe SAV in front of Aoyama Tunnel has raised my music life.The performance of Morita Toko, who was felt in the body, was also deeply engraved in memory.They, after half a century, the Shibuya felt as if the entire city was wrapped in other busy and unchanging air.The military and the old Miyashita park valley feel “Created Culture”.From him, I can hear Bob Dylan's causticity.Since I heard that this is the last construction, Sakurada Familiahwa will not be for a while.Something is always under construction. \ N has a large number of users, but it's not a bigger role compared to other mega stations.There is no large space that can be called the square except the site of the site. \ N It is a narrow site, but there are a lot of JRs, the railroad, and the subway..That's why it's a Shibuya dungeon. \ N \By the way, a huge 3D architecture appears on the wall of the building.I stay in a department store in a nearby Hikari.Watch the 3D video on time.However, please note that 3D Akita Therms will take a break at 7 o'clock every night! \ N \ n3d Akita Dog Show is recommended to wait and watch when passing through Shibuya Station!It's very cute!I used it for lunch on holidays, but I was impressed by the overflowing people because there were a lot of tourists.However, unlike before, I think it is comfortable because it rises to one groove.Connections with other lines can be reached through the same way, but there are famous spots such as bees and scrambled intersections, and beginners recommend going from the ground.JR is a relatively easy way to make, but the bankruptcy is quite deep and it is safe to see +10 minutes.Because there are quite a lot of people, it is difficult to find a cafe, it takes time to find an empty store, or the popular store should wait a lot of time.It has improved, but there are still a lot of construction sites, so it may be inevitable because the line is distracted.On weekdays, young people, such as tourists and Saturday public holidays, are used a lot.4 lines \ n Yamanote Line \3 lines \ n Ginza Line \ n Hanzo Mong Line \ N2 lines \ n Toyoko line \1 Line \ n Inokashira line \ n \ n's ""Shibuya Station"" is separated.Transfer takes time.Since there is a guide, it will arrive if you proceed according to the mark, but when you don't know, let's check the gil order.People feel a lot of danger even on weekdays. \ N \ n I used to use another ticket gate, but I am giving up because it takes time to move.Be careful not to fall on the track. \ N \ N is not used during the commuter time, so you don't know a lot of time zones, but you don't show a station on the Yamanotte home during the recent day of day.Is it a lack of human hands?Keio Line is the same price as a local line.It may be a familiar problem.Is the ""myth of the sun"", the whirlpool of a person at the scrambled intersection.This is the way he understands what the whole country is.Bush, crowd, crowd, car, people, trains, buildings, plane ... everything is located in a very small place.And of course everything is well organized like an art masterpiece.That's why I love this country and the Japanese people so much.thank you ??????…/Even if you are crowded, you can easily explore the station.There is a part of the station that marks JUJUTSU KAISEN (because the current Shibuya incident is in progress).If you think about it, the transfer from the Ginza Line, Inno Kashira Line, or JR is inconvenient.The time required is almost the same express.Express takes a bit of time.I want to sit even if it takes timeIt is usually good. \ N Tokyu Toyoko Line is underground, but it takes time to the ground groove of the Tokyo Metro Ginza Line (Escalator)/Shibuya is a transportation center in Tokyo and a birthplace of many trendy brands.Personally, Shibuya is almost a typical Japanese fashion.Whether it's a bustling intersection, a prototype with a variety of department stores, people ... A strong sense of everyday complexity.I stayed for work, because it was enough time to fill the shopping list slowly, and I had plenty of time.Experience a completely different landscape of day and night.. \ n \ n The only unfortunate place is to eat.Sibuya travel is mainly shopping, so I eat while shopping.Perhaps you eat at Food Court like Shinti Avenue.Especially if you insist on eating, it's a good idea to have homework in advance.In preparation for infectious diseases, wear masks, wash your hands frequently, and maintain social distance.The new station was completed about three and a half years ago, shortly after the infectious disease.This is very impressive./ Shibuya is the most fashionable area in Tokyo, and you can see tourists from all over the world outside Shibuya Station, and foreigners with various faces gather here, knowing that Shibuya is one of the most important places in Tokyo.It can be. \ N, the fact that it is located on the daily commute to Yamanote Line, office workers and students, and the huge pedestrian flow has created the world -famous ""Shibuya Intersection"", the world's most crowded intersection.Take a picture. \ N If you want to feel the charm of the intersection, it's enough to come directly!It is rare to go to Primet, unless you need it.I have a dazzling to me in my 50s.The fact that it is connected to other systems and approaches the famous Hachiko sculpture and all its history, there is a small room that mentions all history.The place where the youngest young man and foreign travelers gather from Tokyo and JAPAN.In any case, the park has changed significantly, and construction such as reforms, renovation and commercial building is carried out.The village is ameling.There are many music relationships such as Crosa, violin, tower records, and HMVs.Despite the density of people on the streets, it is very systematic and safe.There are many things to do in Shibuya.It is a major traffic hub that acts as an important gateway to other areas of the city.Ginza Line is one of the oldest subway lines in Tokyo and passes through the most popular areas of the city, including Shibuya, Ginza, and Asakusa.The station is famous for its lively and lively atmosphere, and many commuters and tourists pass through the station door every day.Through the renovation work, the station will attract the attention of both commuters and tourists and will create a more vibrant atmosphere.The M -shaped roof adds architectural elegance and gives a future -oriented atmosphere.According to the commercial area, including the intersection of the omnidirectional crossroads, up to 3,000 people pass through the intersection during the traffic congestion time. ""In the impression that had no choice but to be redeveloped, it was certainly a new (especially dirty Ginja line platform), but there is no big change in the basic reverse structure.I feel embarrassed and walking. \ N I've also used Yamanote Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line, and Shintamagawa Line (Tokyu Denento), but because it is quite a metastatic, what is the comparison of myself, subtle…Even in January 2005 (2005), there seems to be a construction of the Yamanote Line Home.It may be a frame.A street with different expressions in the east, west and south of the station.Mark City, which has a home of Inokashira, is quite far.//TV's home in Shibuya, which comes from the spell, feels like the world of animation.It is a phase.The era of dirty images where young people of teenagers are torn around the street landscape are already part of the past. \ N \ n?.The streets of the Shin -gu are complicated and coexisting, and the distance of the coming culture is Shibuta.In the midst of laying, how does Shibuya change the end of the front?.. \ n \ n Choo Shin \ n Redevelopment Flow \ n \ n2018 Shibuya Stream \ N2019 Completed Shibuya Flask November \ N2019 Shibuya Scrambled Square Dong Dong -dong business \ n2019N \ n2019 The last day of the change of the groove of the Ginza Line on December 27, 2019 \ n → January 3, 2020, a bright and wide new home opening \ n2020 The home of Kyun and Shonan Shinjuku Line is Yamanote.Later and parallel deployment \ n \ n After this, the Sakuraoka District Development, Hachi Concert Square expanded, Shibuya Scramble Square Sindong Opening, and continued \ n and 2027.2023.4.22 Today, there were a lot of people on tours abroad.Are you from France ?????. \ N Unfamiliar people, including domestic groups, stopped or not a suica, but even if not, the JR Shibuya station, which has been narrowed around the ticket, has been overflowed and changed.I want you to approve Shinjuku Station?There is an impression that is more difficult to move than a station with a large area from the expensive to the depth. \ N This may be called a maze or dungeon.The surrounding buildings are also dried up and redeveloped.JR Sa -Kyo Line Home is transferred to the Yamanote Line, and Yamanote Line's home is a rich and abundant construction. \ NAnd I am worried. \ N because the passage changes a day, it is not meaningful to remember because it changes the passage of the station.It is between the underground of Togenzaka, between A4 and A5.Perhaps we arrive at someone who is struggling./Is there anything in Shibuya?It may be disgusted by the situation of the station or chaos, but there is a dream in this station \ nThere are huge crowds everywhere.For foreigners, the road guide is very easy to understand.The subway is very clean ./ Developed. \ N \ n2022 Temperature: 34 ° C \ n Tokyo corona breaks through 30,000 people!
