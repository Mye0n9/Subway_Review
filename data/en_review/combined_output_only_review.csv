Tokyo Sky Tree Station can go to less than 10 minutes walk from Osiagae Station to Soramachi) \ n \N ◎ Osiage Station is easy to use because it can go to Haneda Airport and Narita Airport without transfer.There are also many fucking trains.Especially on the Hanzo Mon Line, there are a lot of Ocia posts to Shibuya, so it is recommended for those who want to sit and move. \ N \ n ◎ Osiage ~Even if it's a station, the station is different, but the Keisei worship service and Hikihu Na Na are not there).But when you go to worship, the gayse is nearly 10 yen cheaper.In the case, it is necessary to transfer to Dobu Sky Tree Line in Osiage.Let's be careful because the Hanzo Mon Line is folded in Osiage.Skytree Tower is on the station./ The shopping mall has aquariums, shops, restaurants, and snack bars ... suitable for families of all sizes.Finally, it is a bit annoying to feel in Skytree Town. \ N is a simple structure, but it takes time to transfer.I came to Sky Tree because it is rising!It is a station where you can taste the atmosphere./""When I come out of the ticket gate in Ocian, it comes to the Skytree Town entrance in the basement.There are many tourists (unfortunately the ticket gate is in the basement, so the sky tree is not visible in the car window). \ N \ n The sky tree of the Skytree line is nearby, but another station.

In addition, I do not think that the troops and metro legs are not included.It is possible to add other troops, including Seung -ha, and Metro.Dobu Railway was May 1, 1914 (Dai Show 3 years).Seibu Railroad was April 15 in 1915 (Dai Show 4 years).The Youngdan subway was January 20, 1954 (Showa 29).It was a bit complex because Ikebukuro Station is a bit complex because it is composed of the station in the underground passage.\ N \ n because the west exit and the Seibu side are the east exit, the person who wants to go to Sunshine is fine when it comes to the east exit where Seibu is.This time, I headed to Chibu with Seibu's express. \ N ② I took a picture from the traditional coffee shop at 9F at the east exit.Dangerous.You may suffer from a variety of people and a number of

smoked specifications and a very full -hearted ride, so one of the content you want to actively want to go to the rich department is enough!!/Seibu Ike Bukuro Station was boarded at the express. \ n The groove of the train has a dedicated groove for the express train, so the purchase of the express pass was very smooth. \ NEven if the seats are also comfortably, the legs are comfortable, so the

Since the station of the high -priced two -story structure, such as the fortress at 400m, the main branch is Sinagawa, so it is a switch bag in Yokohama and Kawasaki.The runner waiting for the Daiichi Keihin crossing, which was once diverged to Haneda Airport as a ground disconnection, was Pungmul City of Hakone reversal, but now I can no longer see.\ N \ n3 layers are downhill grooves and the second floor is uphill. \ N home is large and long anyway.\ n Vending vending machines are one in the distance. \ n There is one ticket gate.It is convenient to know. \ N \ n If you look outside the airport.many.I'm looking forward to it in the future.In 2019, Sumikogurashi collaborated. \ N It is a delicious and transformed on the second floor to the third floor.I think that convenience is getting worse than the old days.In the stamp rally, you can get sewing dolls or magnets by pressing the stamps such as Kamata Station or Haneda Airport Station.In addition, Sumiko Kurashi train is also running. \ N Yes, even if this is, the groove is divided into the second floor, depending on the thin direction, or the same groove.??It was.It was a very interesting station!/It is a special production called a three -story terminal, and it was the only [switchback method] in the big city.Nothing is different from something else, and you can go to Yokohama, Zhi, Kanazawa, and YRP Nobi on the east of the Gaysey train and Kitaso Railway.The structure of the station has been changed since it has become a continuous three -dimensional relationship between Shinbaba and Kawasaki and the airport line.Since it is a two -layer structure (3rd floor, 3rd floor), it is required to be particularly careful when transferring at the party station.※ For example, the Nicino Airport Line, Right, Odori, Aomori, Aomori, Amanovashi, Sinagawa, and Doei subway are required to be transferred from Dang Station.(Stopping Airport Express is in the direction of Yokohama. Sinagawa passes through a pleasant special operation.)?/It is convenient wherever you go, especially Haneda Airport?An indispensable system that is indispensable to access ?????Sun, it's easier to use ??When China still has a high fare of the airport, I have a holiday outing pass.(laugh)…/Sumiko Kurashi 10th Anniversary Collaboration Event is being held.We sell products with Seven Eleven on the premises.When I stopped at 10/29, the product sold was almost sold out when it was 10/31./Years) Recalled to Kamata Station.There is a sense of tax in the older Kamathatha, the former Kamata Station.N, other, convenience stores, bakery, bars, Talis, Tenya, bookstore Kumazawa, etc. can be used immediately.If you have a big baggage such as a travel bag, the taxi is convenient.. \ n \ N Seven Eleven before the ticket is good, and sometimes a Keikyu product is lined up in front of the store.Although it was a station that caused a congestion, the transportation around the surrounding area is very soft, so \ N I think that even if this age is very successful.It is also recommended because it is quite Otsu to walk towards the JR Gamata Station.I think it's a station. \ N If you are on the 3F, there is a difficult place to get off at 2F.I think it's on the side. \ N ah ah, if you want to get down on the lower floor, you have to go to the center near Yokohama ???I completely forget about the precautions.I was very sad. \ N Mr. \ N will be kind to me, but I'm familiar with a specific dragon, a person who is heading to Haneda Airport, a person who is heading to the Daejeon -gu Industrial Center PIO.\ NJR Camata Station is accumulating various commercial facilities and accommodations (10 minutes on foot, 600 ~ 700m), and there are also shopping streets at the west exit of this station.On the rainy days of the Lian deck, you can go and come and go without a lot of wet.This is. \ N \ N The driver, which was divided into a crossword such as a crossword, is a plus point.. \ n \ n This extremely long and complex structure is a negative point for users who actually use the station to the home by transferring the station. \ nFor local residents who have been dating, the passage of airport pleasure is nothing other than betrayal.\ n \ n's best problem is that this ""Kamata Fortress"" is not in advance of the news of the passage of airports in the local area.It was used for months. \ N When I was moving to the 9th camp of the former director of the apartment, it was an 8 -minute walk from the nearest station, but now the nearest station is a 30 -minute walk from Umeya Shiki Station and a 40 -minute walk.It is used to use the Keikyu Bus.// Before entering the ticket gate, let's check the destination on the entire billboard. \ N ② There are three destinations.On the left side of the bulletin board, please find a train from Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Haneda.Since the destination varies depending on the floor, 【Absolute】 is confirmed before riding!The groove of the bulletin board is riding. \ N ④ The Haneda airport is the right side of the second floor.Home No. 1 to Haneda Airport Home No. 4, there is a train that arrives from the airport due to the nature of the switch white light, so be careful! \ NOn the second floor, we arrive from Kanagawa and divide it into Umeya Shiki/Heiwajima/Sinagawa and Haneda.The number of grooves is different, so if you are not used to it, it will be a little awkward.It is definitely convenient for passing through the Haneda Airport train, but if you try to transfer or transfer in Keikyu Kamata, it becomes incredibly complicated.Listening to the announcement of the car in the car or the home of the home.This is the secret that does not fail in Keikyu.But there were so many trains from the airport, and in addition, it was fast when I thought I got a riding speed.There is such a convenient place.Tokyo is a great place.N, especially the second line is really difficult. \ N Is it not possible to transfer in the same home by train or the worst.Either Tokyo leads to an accessible airport. \ N shopping, food, accommodation.It is all over and all is equipped.Express) The 5th line is usually the train Sinagawa, the 6th line is Sinagawa, Izumi Dakge, Doei Asakusa Line, and other railroads, the 3rd floor is Haneda Airport, Yokohama, and the second line is usually the train Yokohama, 3Since the turning line is complicated with Misaki Kuchi and Yokohama, it is necessary to check with the LED display, and the bus stop other than the kamatha station is in front of Daiichi Gehin, who crosses the ticket gate and crosses the press bridge on the left.The train of the suspension of the party passes through, ”he said.I can't figure it out completely. \ N \ n There is only one advantage.It is said to be very convenient for those who say that they can only be used by passing through Kamata Station.You can go to Haneda Airport at once at the Asaku Line and go to Haneda Airport without a transfer in the Sinsko.The opposite is so. \ N \ n.However, there are more disadvantages.The grooves are divided into two and three floors and are ""disconnected parallel"", which is why it is strangely long.Each train is located in Yokohama, Sinagawa, and Haneda Airport.\ n \ n wants to connect to a car in Kamata, or want to transfer to the train from Sinawa to the train from Haneda Airport.There is only a labyrinth for those who say. \ N \ n There is only one solution.First of all, if you want to get off at the Keikyu Kamata Station and use the transfer, \ n “I want to transfer to ○○ from Keikyu Kamata Station, but how can I move when I arrive?\ N, ""I ask the station in the ride station.""/The local country is the best in the country.It is a branch of the Haneda Airport Line, and it is a difficult rescue and indication that is unknown to tourists and foreigners..The two doors have no doors in this position.Although there are signs such as, there is no vehicle or door mark on the front light bulletin board, so I don't know where it would be good at all.Some people may say it's okay, but even if you are waiting for it, you will suddenly change due to delay. \ N ★I don't know at all.It is a sudden in -house announcement, and if it is a line opposite, if the layer changes, the stairs are moved to the folklore \ n ★ The same home, but there are other turns (5 and 6 lines) before and after.It lines.Therefore, if you need a dash of 100 meters in the transfer (laughs) \ n ★ It is difficult to know, but there is no station in the home other than the rush..As a transit station at Haneda Airport, which is used by tourists at home and abroad, at least, at least, even if the station or the minimum is not provided, it is an unkindness station that is not a story.There is a house far away.The supermarket feels narrow, but the product is faithful. \ N The restaurant is rich in variety and not difficult./ It is difficult to understand if you do not check the place for ordinary passengers, but it is called the first popular for 'Cheol -chan' enthusiasts..Anyway, get off and experience it calmly./ I always confuse signs and platforms here.Even the Google map is not displayed where to go.I live near Joshiki Station, but I went to Keikyu Kawasaki because of the ordinary train.The station where the fast stops.& Haneda Airport?/The train signs here can be very confusing. \ N \ n Some of the platforms show multiple destinations (e.g. Platform 4).As a foreigner, I thought I mean each train stopped on the platform to these two.But not.This means that the train to different destinations uses the same platform.If you don't check the billboard, you can also board the wrong train!If you go to the airport in a hurry, the situation may be bad.The airport express that stops at each airport line is the 4th line on the second floor.This 4th line is a song that requires attention because the agency of the Japanese airport is also stopped at this home.Since it is currently being an event, I think this sign (see photo) is listed.It is recommended to check the guide marks of the station.!If you leave Haneda Airport, some of them stop at Keikyu Kamata Station, but the airport pleasant will not stay in \ n Keikyu Kamata Station, so be careful!!!!!!!!!! \ N approach melody is a dream!/It's been a long time since I transferred to Keikyu Kamata

to challenge after preparing in advance.Did you become a specialty of Hakone reversal?Recently, it has a high -priced line, so it doesn't matter.Haneda Airport, Keikyu Kawasaki, Yokohama, Kami Oka,

interfere with the near future.I wandered away without knowing how to ride./It is a good station to use the Keikyu Line.In particular, this station is connected to Haneda Airport.If you are coming from downtown Tokyo, you should change the train to the airport here.If you need a hotel for early flight the next day, it is recommended to use this nearby hotel.You can access the airport.You can also enjoy great food.Enjoy!But now there is no cross -crossing wooden. \ N The street landscape is once a crowded pub streets across JR Gamata Station, but now it is a completely calm atmosphere.Of course, as you get closer to JR in the stone, you will see a kamata.Since there were a lot of airport officials around Kaikyu, there was a different atmosphere than Kamata, but I think it was more clean by the recent redevelopment.It seems to be more exciting because it seems to be able to open it nearby.There are two types of escalators going to 2F and going directly to 3F's grooves.I was embarrassed because I had to ride after checking on the bulletin board in advance.It is recommended to be used in time.In addition, there is a distance from JR and Tokyu Kamatha Station.Since the front is the distance of the basic base workers, the security is not good, the burger that was in the morning..The groove is a two -story building, and the grooves for each station stop by the

crossroads and the airport line and the direct communication of the airport line between Omori -cho and Villa / Color Colors.It is a three -story building of the ground history, and the second floor is determined by the upper line and the top floor as a descending line, but this is a single parallel structure that allows you to smoothly direct the direct train of Yokova.When you leave the station

more paints like the Jay Street station with the letters on the floor to the elevator.Sometimes people are on a call, so I can't hear what's talking about in Intercom, sometimes there are too many people, so I don't want to get out of the station, or I'm scared when I speak myself mentally.From my door exit.There is a snack.There is no elevator for the disabled after remodeling.This is an open station.Do not confuse Queensboro Plaza and Queens Plaza.Trains, destinations and different functions are different places.N/W is easily transferred to 7th across the platform when heading to Manhattan.If you need to switch again, use the stairs.Sometimes there are times when the train is not operated, so you need to take a shuttle on the street.The bus is not right below ... just follow the crowd.From here, you can take one stop to G and access Brooklyn without leaving Manhattan.It can only be used after 18 minutes after running.It's a pity ./ I always had a bad experience in this station.Astoria rows (N) and (W) do not seem to appear at all every time they transfer in (7) in flushing.This station has a resentment to me.And no matter what carrier you use, it is not good to receive.I waited for N/W to relieve stress and meditated.Don't worry if you don't have much time to do so because it takes three times more time to go to N/W to Queensboro Plaza.By the time the train arrives, the stress will be relieved to some extent.This valuable space can be easily rewarded with a train vehicle that will soon be filled.Where should I do it?I only talk about the top level and the rest is a secret.Good luck!Movement between N/W and 7 is very easy across the platform.Remember that the direction of each floor is the same.The bottom is Manhattan row and the top is Queen's row./ I like Queens Boro Plaza.I hope N and W will run more often.. \ n \ n There are the north exit and the south exit, and the overpass is very similar, so the exit is wrong.The two stations are close, but completely different stations. \ N \ n Queens Burger Plaza Station appears in the decisive scenes of the planet of the film and monkey (not actually). ""Go to Queens City Field. Queen Svoro Square is one of the main ways to go to the train. N, W, 7 trains.Crescent Street, Queens Plaza is right next to the road.The night view from the train station platform is really cool. Manhattan Skyline is also really cool. \ NRemember.Move a long way downstairs and move downstairs for trains 4 and 5./Located in the central part of the long island city, you can always transform the platform between Line 7 and N/W train.The service is a mixed bag (2-4 (7) train has a 1-2 (n/w) train). The upper floor is for the Queen's train, and the lower floor is for the Manhattan train.There is an overpass. It does not comply with the ADA and usually has garbage at the top level.It is the only New York City subway station. This station always operates Line 7 and N, and the off -season will operate <7> and W -lines on weekdays.It operates this station with six other stations by the 4th of the month. It is three years after the R188 vehicle was assigned in 7. It is also close to Queens Plaza but no free transfer.If this lacks, it will cause confusion.It can be really cold in winter, but in summer, it tends to provide a beautiful sunny view.The only way that requires some modifications is:Schedule adjustment between the Broadway line (N, W) and the 7th line.Can I reduce the overcrowding of this station if it is connected to a nearby Queens Plaza station with a small number of passengers?Perhaps ..?/Unfortunately, homeless people are sleeping across the seat and have a smell of urine. Where are the people who will help homeless people?It is not enough and the Russian War decides to send a randomly extract to Astoria Blvd.Astoria continues to expand and the MTA continues to play its role.There is no place where the incompetence of the MTA is as well as here./ There are three constants, but there is no need to wait for a long time, and the only difficulty is that it is rainy and the roof is severely damaged, but water leaks, but there is no need to walk for transfer.You can ride Line 7., W and N./are pretty good and clean.You can move to almost everywhere in New York at that station ./ Very peaceful area/public transportation is not to be mentioned.The experience is that I went home by train.Do you need to say anymore?Cleanliness is the same as anywhere else in the city.The elevator for the mother who is dragging a stroller must be installed with the maintenance.And cars should stop between the stops and do not ventilate well !!Kobid still exists. This is one of the most crowded traffic hubs in the city where several bus routes and subway lines stop here.Don't get off the train here.I won't be able to hear the news again.Here, two lines are connected.The cleanliness has a lot of unfortunate things, but this is the standard of NYC public places.The upper level is 3 levels higher than the distance level./ This is a train station that seems to need more work./ New York's 100 -year -old subway is still dirty after cleaning.The slope is tough, but the landscape from the summit is wonderful/good/a good station close to some hotels and restaurants./The toilet is closed at 11 am, but there are many people looking for the bathroom.I will have a good weekend with my family./ The stairs are unstable.It is a place where repair is needed./I liked to ride the subway anywhere!Meet new people!/High subway station.Above all, it is clean/especially on the weekends, N trains are very lacking.It's very cold in winter!/It's amazing place/Super Megapos N Train/Train Station, I think it's at the entrance of Queens.The sound grows here./Where to transfer/I stayed in 2016.This station is dangerous at night.It is annoying for the elderly/it's okay/I like this because it's cold in winter/(w) because I have been serviced again.It's icon!/I always use this train station.I'm pretty busy/it's okay.

RENE came to us.He not only helped us find the perfect car, but also provided amazing deals.At least my family and I are very satisfied with the new car./I do not like women working in tokens.The unpleasant attitude of people who sit there and do diarrhea and receive money.If I ask an example or no question, do not add lips, but forget the teacher, or the teacher's answer.I am not your child.Because you are forgetting your place.Queensboro Plaza is one of them.The advantage is that it provides a great and well -time train service.Manhattan's Venetian decoration is not really in this world.Since MTA is working on the signal upgrade of Line 7 and the two stations of the N/W line are being renovated, especially on the weekend, you should be careful about changing the service.He grew up in Ridge and joined the Marine Corps and retired in 2000.I really miss you just to see.From 2010 to 2016, the Q train operated a different station from this station and Astorian line.The shuttle bus is very slow.Taxi time./ On weekends, most of them are always cracked in the station, even if they are disabled in a wheelchair, the elevator for the disabled is where the elevator is and the staircase feels (or down)!It's annoying!"
141,The escalator from the G to the 7th train rarely works.It is best to use this to transmit G to 7.

This is the only MTA problem: This station is on G and goes to a short square to exchange with G to 21 or +.It would be good to open the G platform in this station so that it would be a good man who evaluated the New York subway as five stars.At best, there are some parts in 2.Chicken chili sauce…/I don't like this station very much.There is no toilet and there are too many people in this station.It's not very dirty, but there's no double floor going to the platform that goes in the opposite direction.There is also no wheelchair access and greeting booths.But I think it's good on the ground/a little work may be needed./The second love in Queens.If you live in Queens, it's best for you./It's not a passionate fan of this stop.There are a lot of people in Hispanics/Very comfortable trip.Thanks to the service./ A good place for quiet and peaceful minds.I usually have a police officer ..../Be more often cleaned/great/Manhattan's wonderful view.The train stops here."

I was surprised at so much beauty.Design, lighting, building, ceiling picture ... It was really fantastic and it is still.Take it wherever you go to your destination like a city trip.There are also trains on Line 4 and Line 5 for express, and free transfers are faster than local trains such as Line 6.Even if you stand under the beautiful constellation on the ceiling, you will find out what the main lobby is.While in New York, everyone should try to walk this beautiful building./ Well .... impressive.It is soft and clean and has a bathroom and a nice arched oyster.It must be completed.And Saturday/Sunday is a waste of time.MTA is a joke.??It's not a safe place…/A wonderful building that can be around.It's ashamed, but they agreed to put the Apple Store in it.It is worth seeing and there are various foods and drinks options.It was much more impressive than I thought!/Very well managed and preserved terminal.I'm in the movie.The ceiling has a constellation and lights drawn like stars.It is a large terminal.The glorious main hall, decorated with Tennessee's marble floor and Italian marble ticket office, is covered with an arched ceiling depicting the constellation designed by the French painter Paul C? Sar Helleu.When the commuters complained that the sky was upside down (it was drawn as if looking down from the top), it was insisted to be intentional (perhaps I don't want to admit the error)..The interior is so cool and there are many places to eat in the restaurant.The ceiling was probably my favorite part!/That details and plans went into this station.Don't just run around, but spend time to enjoy architecture and build.The overall structure is well and it is not bad to transfer with other trains.The memory of this station is that you have to get a LIRR ticket in order not to use the LIRR ticket after a month.I tried to deal with the recent news of the huge ticket gate, but again, it is closer to the systematic problem of NYC that has flowed into the MTA rather than the MTA's fault./ I had great expectations for the New York subway, but I used this transportation system.Is completely disaster.First of all, the train was frequently delayed, and when the next train would arrive, I waited for a long time at the platform without any information.The air conditioning of some trains was not noticeable because it was not present or too weak.On the hot summer day, the train was like a sauna, and by the time I arrived at my destination, my sweat was soaked.I have seen many times that rats wander around the track, and some stations have a terrible smell.The lack of cleanliness felt that it was unstable and not safe.As a tourist, I knew it was difficult to explore the system and often found that I was lost or riding a wrong train.It became more difficult to find a way because of the lack of clear signs and announcements.Frequent delays, overcrowded trains, lack of air conditioning, dirty stations, and confusing maps have been an unpleasant and stressful experience.I will not recommend this transportation system to anyone.Clean the station because there are many passengers on weekends and labor days.I'm very glad to see this station and it's fortunate to be stored .../The beautiful thing is that cleanliness, information services and security are all in your service, clarifying inquiries and modifying the path.Is bad and there's no way to improve it.The platform is small and not safe.Train 7 is relatively new, clean and much cleaner than other routes.The Central Terminal (GCT, Grand Central Station [N 2] or simply called Grand Central) is a commuter train terminal located in 42st Street in Manhattan Midtown, New York City and Park Avenue.Grand Central connects the northern part of New York to the southern part of the Harlem, Hudson, and New HAVEN routes of Metro-North Railroad.In addition, it is connected to the Long Island Railroad through the Grand Central Madison station, a 16-acre (65,000m2) rail terminal under the Metro-North station built from 2007 to 2023.The terminal is also connected to New York City.Grand Central? 42nd Street Ride the subway.The terminal is the second -largest train station in North America, following the New York Penn Station.Borjar design contains numerous works of art.Grand Central Terminal is one of the top 10 tourist attractions in the world.In 2018, 21.6 million visitors visited except for train and subway passengers.

147,"The subway station opened with the opening of Hudson Yards.It is a subway station in Manhattan in 25 years.IT is a subway station in manhattan in 25 years./ Very close to Vessel, this station is quite new compared to other subway stations.It is one of the coolest products with the new design.The platform is clean and has a lot of design.The long escalator is the highlight of this station and the lighting is good.It's so clean and shiny.It also feels so future -oriented.I hope it will be updated like this.It is one of the most crowded lines that come and often come.The station is clean and there is a NYPD nearby.It is also fun to take a picture of people who go up and down with the camera parallel to the escalator.They seem to be inclined forward or back.Grandmen like this picture./ The building is really amazing.You can buy a ticket on the page or stand in line in the building. \ N enjoy a picture that you can get by taking a good camera., Please refer to it. \ N did well/as a picture of New York, beautiful and modern subway lines/This person is aggressive.He threatened to hit you and do something lewd to the person sitting opposite.As a result, we reported to the police in the finals.She came and saw him and immediately started wearing a jacket and did not admit anything.The police turned around and left.This man also stayed in it while the train was moving.Perhaps it will be very clean because it is not as much traffic as other central herbal stations.In most cases, there are MTA staff in the booth.Except for distance elevators.The outside is dirty and the interior is used as a urinal.The longest of the escalators I have seen.Very clean and bright lighting. \ N The highline is nearby.It is deep underground, so when the elevator and escalator go out, you will be hiking immediately.The modern glass exterior and the works of art on the ceiling of the escalator are very beautiful and colorful.The train has arrived on time/New York is pretty good compared to other subway stations in New York.There is a nice ceiling picture in the lobby.It is modern and clean, and I have the longest escalator I've been riding so far!Located on Line 7, it is connected to major stations such as Times Square and Grand Central.This is the best station to explore Hudson Yard (The Edge, Vessel, etc.) and highline!/I like this station so much.The only problem I am in this place is that the waiting time can be long (sometimes) and one of the most common places I don't like in NYC.This is the most fun thing you will experience in a dystopian nightmare that Hudson Yards is abandoned.It looks like it is.The tile work is beautiful, and the new New York is progressing.The new subway stations have been built in the last two years, and are basically the latest facilities, and the decorative style is very modern.Compared to other subway stations, you can definitely feel the difference.However, as you can see, this escalator is very long and very high, so if you have high phobia, you may be uncomfortable.Close your eyes and try it! \ N7 is very convenient for the last stop of the line, and three stops to the Times Square, the Grand Central Station, and the other ends are famous flushing.I recommend you to try it.If you do not have a subway card, you can buy $ 3 a one -way one -way, and if you add $ 1 to the charging amount, you only pay $ 2.75.If you are traveling, you can also buy a 3 or 7 days pass.Even monthly passes, the MTA's subway and bus service can be used for free depending on the period of stay in New York.During that period, it is still very cost -effective and economical. \ N When using the subway time zone, it is the same as the tonsil subway fee, and can be transferred to the bus from the bus and the bus to the subway.However, transfer is free.Once you get off the subway, it's not free to enter the subway, so please be careful if you are transferring.Thank you for your support!It was a great experience, but it was a great experience.It was very easy to rush and come out of the station.It is very centered on the ground./ Clean Station.If you take an escalator, it can cause dizziness for some people, so make sure that long escalators (if you don't ride an elevator) are okay.The only problem in the IS station is about train 7, which runs the station.It is also convenient and another charm for walking with children.View is free.Here you can spend all day and visit here four times. //34 -Hudson Yards is the New York City subway station in Manhattan West Side on the IRT flushing line.Opened on September 13, 2015, this station is the first subway expansion work that has been paid in the city in more than 60 years!The station is modern, clean, and unique!/It's one of the latest stations I've seen and I recommend it a lot.It would be nice if it was updated in real time.Other than that, the station close to work is really good!/It's one of my favorite subway stations in Manhattan!If you go down the long altitude, the lights are so bright that it feels like a space station!/This subway station is really beautiful from outside.But the interior is the same as other subway stations.Vassel, The SHED, The Shops, The Edge, and Skyline are here.there is.There is a huge steep escalator.It was like a slow roller coaster and I was waiting for death.It is not for those with high phobia, but I like the design of the subway station.It's never crowded or full like Times Square, but there are many people.This station is located near the train station dock, and I think that such a large terminal is not suitable for a single 7 train, so there should be more trains passing through this station.Overall, if you go up and down a few times, you'll get used to steep escalators.It is a new and clean station.The controlled environment is very helpful for cold and hot days.Since the opening of Hudson yards, this station has a convenient move to the store and park.The inclined elevator is the only thing in the system (as of 2020) because it is the most interesting.The new station means that the wanderer does not get rid of or that the famous NYC subway urine odor.All are new and clean.Because of the deep inside, there is a tremendous long escalator passage.Go back and look down and look down.I was surprised to see the mops on the train.Overall, this is one of the best stations in the city.In addition, it has a modern design.To get on the train, you have to take a long escalator, which is the only disadvantage.There is much more space to walk and much deeper underground.I hope that the escalator will be used continuously.And over time, the area is likely to be active due to new construction.This station is connected to the deep underground and can be moved to the long escalator.Because it is new, it has a minimalist appearance that contains very clean and breathable air.The lighting is also very good./ The best subway station!It's a bit unfair but still amazing because it's a new station and all the other stations are quite old.A wonderful station that is constantly being cleaned, and seriously, if you go there at any time, someone will clean it.West side and Chelsea have been greatly improved.Take 7 and go to Queens, Port Authority or Grand Central.There is always a delay, and the staff does not tell the cause of the delay.There are cameras, PA systems, and the Internet, but we cannot continue to provide information.Do not remove homeless people from the train to make it safer.And the guards of the window show their attitudes because you ask questions.This represents the huge cities of modern transportation hubs that represent the world's capital.If I can go to this station alone, it will be a welcome experience (except for some different stations).At this time, the facilities are clean, easy to pass and enjoy it.You can connect to all routes. \ N \ n This station is a state -of -the -art station, and according to my experience, there is always a train waiting for departure.There is not so many people now.It is clear that there is a very large plan for the area, and the MTA ensures that it can accommodate the future crowds.Unlike the bathroom tiles, it looks very modern and clean because of the beautifully designed murals decoded on the wall.Do not misunderstand.There is nothing opposite to classical construction, but it feels like the entire bathroom tile installation work that has been in progress for decades is in a huge toilet.7, which ends here, is only hopeful of the crowds that will be flocked to the surrounding development area./ This is a new station (relatively) with modern buildings, but if you look closely, you can wear signs and maintenance defects (eg escalator ceiling)). \ N \ n and exaggerated escalator.That's right.It's long, but it's long, but go to the DC subway and see what the deep subway station looks like.Oh, and the DC subway station is much older, but it looks more new and the management is better.They are definitely doing something right.The MTA seems to never be found.I don't like it.The escalator is steep and long.It is unimaginable to climb up and down the stairs.You can easily walk to Hudson Yards and Javits Convention Center.Very good station.It's very perfect./Beautiful station with one of the longest escalators in the world.It is very new and very convenient for the extra west and the Javits Center.Also, for those who need it, you can access the disabled by using an escalator and elevator.It is also a wonderful ending station where you can line up to the end.Besides, 7 is a great thing in the city, you can go anywhere and connect with everything.This is a quick way to attend the event of the Javits Center.The station is modern and the park on it is wonderful.The worst part is a long escalator that runs from the track to the distance./ This station, built for the future high -rise building community around 34th and 11th Street, is a modern added station to the MTA subway system.The huge front door is in a dead end, and there is an elevator.(The entire station comply with ADA.) The upper mezzanine has a toilet, the lower mezzanine has a lot of space, and there is a display on the wall.As with expectations for future crowds, the platform level is very wide.The whole station is also bright.(The only reason for the four stars is that leaks have been reported around the station ... but it is expected to be because the station was built near the river.)The last station of the route .../Amazing subway station.This is a good way to go west.The Jarvis Center is on the corner and offers a breathtaking view of the highline.A must -see attraction.If you are in Grand Central or Time Square, take 7 here.I was a little surprised by the big escalator.It is interesting to ride a long and deep escalator.The depth is 109 feet.It is also interesting that the elevator in the station is also inclined.Please check if you are on your own.You can use the convention center and the new HUDSON YARDS area under construction.ㅋㅋㅋ It was fun to surf the subway by riding the trains 7 times from Hudson Yard 34.In fact, it's really a good breeze/Thanks to this new station, it's very close to the Megabus platform.There is also a new station, and the station premises are kept clean, and even many works of art are available.The escalator is quite long, but you can sit comfortably and ride comfortably.One of the most popular places is the Highline Park, which is currently extending to 34th Street. \ N \ nIt provides a great view.Including straight.Wow!There is only one block away from the Jacob Javis Convention Center and Highline Park.The Hudson River and New Jersey's prospects are so beautiful.A must -visit place.I've been to the bus stop for the first time.I met MTA Chairman Andy byford.I went into the classic city bus.The classic bus had leather seats.I also went into a new two -car bus that adds a WiFi charger.They change the color in front of the city bus.There are dark blue, sky blue, yellow, and sky blue.I like a new MTA bus with two WiFi chargers like a snake.It is the best vehicle for the MTA bus.I want to go to another bus stop in the future.But there is no signal for the next train.There is no police officer who can help the platform ./34 Street-Hudson Yard Subway Station is one of the most future-oriented buildings in the Manhattan subway system in New York.So if you are going to Hudson Yard, take a train from Midtown to experience this wonderful ride and destination. \ N \ n #crossstownmanhattan #no7subway #NEWYORKCITY #ArtIntransitIt has the most cool street entrance among NYC subway stops.This is a big victory for us who visit the Javits Center.The javits center entrance is 2 blocks away.Useful Tips: The last car of the train is closer to the entrance to the Javits Center.Unfortunately, there are no signs to help find the best exit in the track level.Last stop.Retro Mirae. Use this station to visit the retro future./vessel or Hudson Yards./ New York City is a very wonderful and new subway station in New York City.Usually clean and good.The only problem is that the mobile phone signal is not serviced.The escalator of this subway station is very long.I've never experienced it until this time.BM1 and BM3 buses are not reliable at all after 8 pm.Returning to Brooklyn.I waited for a long time for the bus to come down from the 5th Street, and I had to take a train back to my home very late around 9:45 pm.They were supposed to come in 8:12 8:36 9:12 9:32, but no one came.It looks like you came from another city, but when the train arrives late and becomes dirty, you realize that it is still New York.It's quite deep underground, so be prepared for long escalators and long rows/crowds that use it.Otherwise, it's not noticeable.From shopping to a new tower that dominates the skyline, this new area of Manhattan really surpasses itself!Especially the works and murals are really beautiful.The stairs are steep but are escalators, so be careful.There is an elevator for the disabled.In addition, as of 2017, many constructions are underway.There is almost no long escalator, and the end is also required.Is there an elevator for the disabled?Hudson yard is already a new city center in New York.Several office practical high -rise buildings have been built, and the highline park has increased the spot due to The SHED Cultural Complex and several new restaurants./ New York has a very clean and future -oriented design.Especially the mosaic at the entrance.Similar to the Canary Wharf Subway Station in London./ Very modern and clean subway!There are a few wonderful mosaics.I went to this station and rode it several times when I went back home on the express train/This is the best subway station in New York City.It's so clean and new, so it's the best ever./Clean and good station ..

187,"New York City Hall Subway Station.There's nothing special, and it's a good idea to get off here to cross the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.My favorite train is the R142A subway with the JESSCIA advertisement.I hope that the MTA will record this fact and re -publish the original announcement in the Lexington Avenue Line, which started NYC and all human life in the city.As an African -American, it is worth $ 2.90 for subway fare, so pay the fee.Because it provides value.If you go to other states, there is no transportation.Or maybe I'm always looking at 777, or it's just lucky.I liked this place!It is easy to walk from Brooklyn to New York, and the subway can be easily reached nearby.The view is really cool!Everyone must take this walk!/It's a big train station for those who want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, but it's more suitable for locals who have to go to the shopping area.Either way, it's a train station that doesn't work more than moving from one place to another.It is recommended to take the tennis because the promenade is long.It is a street.For example, a group of elephants pass by to prove that it is reliable and not fraud.It was created before the existence of a car.You must remember that there is a bicycle path (respect it and the bike passes at full force).Even if the lock is visible, it cannot be left, a fine is imposed, and the lock is very likely to be lost the next day.It is easy to cross the bridge or take the subway to Manhattan.no see.There is a faded magnificence.If you stay on the subway, you can see when it will change from downtown to uptown.Do not be afraid of leaving all passengers.It is embarrassing that the bottom line is not so magnificent.It is functional but nothing special.It is very convenient to maintain a better sign for the exit and the beautiful tiles that have seen a better time (a few years ago).I took a taxi before, but the driver was lost in the wrong position.The subway saves our lives and taxis are very expensive.I want to go back to Manhattan later.It's much more convenient than Staton Island.It usually runs on time/I was in Brooklyn to see my sister, it was a great day.It was crowded with people, but it did not reduce my great experience.I recommend visiting this symbolic place and keeping it clean, and I believe it is forbidden to put a lock on the leg fence.Everything seems to be fine.Brooklyn's beautiful panoramic..It is recommended to walk in the direction of the Brooklyn Bridge downtown by the subway.It was built in 1909.It is natural without modern tools.It would have been adversity.Beautiful building.The interior is empty.Line 4 and Line 6 are running under it.They no longer build these buildings.This place is convenient to go anywhere.The World Trade is about 5-6 blocks from Chinatown and Little Italy./ The City Hall Loop, which was opened in 1104, was once a luxurious terminal station used by about 600 passengers a day.Passenger trips through this station have been suspended after 40 years due to the rapid increase in the New York population.Today you can visit the station only at a very specific time of a year.At one time, it was a popular spot where locals and travelers could see the complex designs of the past, but they were closed in the mid -20th century.In addition, all trains on Line 6 form the end of this place, and the direction is changed to the opposite direction.But what most people don't know is that if Line 6 continues to ride, the track passes through the old and abandoned city hall.It is very interesting but not much to see the lights of the train rarely shine the old platform, and the light upstairs is coming through the stairs that go up to the city hall.It's very fun to see, but it's not very good to take a picture./If you take train 6, which is the last station, keep boarding the train.why?You can meet beautiful and historical viewing.I think it was closed in the 20s.If you pass it, train 6 will appear again on the uptown platform.The new station is beautiful.I like the iron cable around the entrance of the city hall, but keep the interval in mind when getting on the train and getting off.The station is a bit bent./I highly recommend it to see the clean and old city hall stop after the train of Line 6 continued to ride around.It's just changing the direction, and you can get off at the station in the north direction.Climbing the stairs is full of noisy atmosphere.The park had a great crowd and performers who are doing all kinds of acts.The choices to go and the direction to go are somewhat overwhelming, but the stairs were the first step of the journey across the Brooklyn Bridge.If you are going to travel, please prepare.If the weather is good, there will be a lot of people who take a walk. \ N If you go back to the review you looked forward, this station has a lot of lines to go anywhere.Make sure you downloaded the app so you can see which train to take.I was going to the wrong road several times before I found the app!If you visit Brooklyn Bridge (1 minute walk), Wall Street or World Trade Center (10-15 minutes walk), the location is really convenient.And if you also visit the Grand Central Terminal, you can take a minimum of 15 minutes by riding the express train 4 or 5 times here.You can keep staying while returning, and you can get a glimpse of the beautiful and abandoned city hall.Many people seem to have done this without any consequences.But if I was caught, I read that the MTA could impose a fine of $ 50 or more.If you want to have a good tour, you can check the ticket at the New York Transportation Museum, which is usually difficult to get a ticket because the ticket is sold out quickly without a tour.This station is accessible to wheelchairs and provides mobile phone services and free Wi-Fi.There is also a departure sign that tells you when the train will come.If you stay in Line 6, which has been on the end, you can get a glimpse of the ruined city hall station.Travel! \ N \ n. Our guide was very well aware of the history of the area and had a passion for architecture.This was actually added to the tour.My only problem is that NYTM does not tell me in advance that audio equipment is used on the tour.(I'm not a deaf, but I have a little bit of difficulty in the sound of a particular type.

Find a shop with a shop.There are many men and foreigners recruiting guests on the side of the road.It is better not to go.I've done it many times.This time it was okay, but I don't know when it will happen.So I suggest not to believe in a man who drives guests on the side of the road.Even if I did before, I have succeeded many times in a way of gathering guests on the side of the road.But today I was cheated by 24,500 yen because I gathered guests on the roadside. The degree of technique and intimidation still surprised me.Everyone knows that the underground world of Japan is legal and the police will not interfere.There are advantages and disadvantages, but honestly, I hope it will be clearly translated so that Japanese people can understand.This time, the price is just a little cheaper than others.I am a customer who can compare the price.If the price is much lower than the normal price, you will understand that there is a problem.I can no longer say because I know that Japanese people are very smart.This time, I was recruiting guests from the roadside, and the person who recruited guests from the side first told me what I needed, and asked me about the regulations, and there was no regulation at all.Before I came to Kabuki -cho, I knew that there were a lot of regulations in the Japanese world, and I was told that people who did not keep them were cut off.So I always ask first and check many times so that everything is clear.I took me to the hotel and paid for it.The room was charged 13,000 yen first and the hotel fee was 1,500 yen.He told me to check it again and down several times from downstairs.The hotel has opened a new room.There was no big problem at the counter and it was very smooth.In the room, he told me to call the girl and call the girl before he claimed 13,000 yen.Of course, he confirmed that the total price is 14,500 yen and the hotel is 1,500.He charged 13,000 yen and called the woman, and she arrived in less than five minutes.As soon as I put down the bag outside the door to go to the bathroom, she came in and asked where.The person who introduced me downstairs also knew the terrain of the hotel, and as soon as I entered the hotel, he introduced the overall layout of the hotel.When I went to the bathroom and entered the room, she asked me to take a shower first, and my stuff was outside, but I asked if I would like to take a shower together.The girl refused.I respected the opinions of the girls and went to take a shower alone.I took a shower quickly because the things would be stolen, and the girl said that it couldn't be for me.He told me to wear clothes and asked what kind of service he wanted., I said in advance, so I don't have to claim anymore.The cheapest plan for women was 30,000 won, which is more expensive.The money he gave to the introduction was not counted at all. The person was too high. The salary was so high that he didn't leave it anyway.It is possible to cancel.I pointed my body and said, ""I took off my clothes. How do you cancel?""Anyway, I asked a few times and I couldn't cancel it for free.The cancellation fee is at least 10,000 yen.Refuses to wear clothes.The lowest plan is massaged for 30,000 yen.In the end, he canceled without saying anything and refused to use money.Please let me go anyway.Eventually, he originally used an additional 10,000 yen for 14,500 yen, and the girl left without anything.If you are going to the custom shop, you can go to the ""Information Store"" to accept it even if you cancel it after considering.But the risk of recommending guests on the side of the road is very high.The price of ""drink and putting"" is not very high, and it does not threaten to take clothes or things.Personally, whether or not to report it to the police, it is your problem that Japanese police gangsters are allowed, customized shops are allowed, and custom stores and gangs are not allowed to say that there is a problem.There is a problem if a gang is a problem.If there is a problem, there will be no evidence, otherwise the gangsters of the world will be protected.Keep looking for someone to retaliate.Anyway, it's all legal.The whole Japanese society is not trying to solve the problem.The environment is cleaner and less garbage. If you go deep into Japan, you will understand. You haven't experienced this pain, so if you see this, I know you want to laugh at it.There is nothing I can do and I'm helpless.If you meet me someday, you will understand.If you want something else rather than ""drinking and attaching the title,"" go to the milk case office.I can't win.Please keep these illegal and non -shoppers from surviving ~~ Please make Japan better in this field.Why are there more more ""foreign"" beggars in Japan's streets?His present may be our future.Oh, but I don't want to swear, but I will surely be retaliated.I dare to say that you deceived many foreigners and they all paid normally.

A strong sense of everyday complexity.I stayed for work, because it was enough time to fill the shopping list slowly, and I had plenty of time.Experience a completely different landscape of day and night.. \ n \ n The only unfortunate place is to eat.Sibuya travel is mainly shopping, so I eat while shopping.Perhaps you eat at Food Court like Shinti Avenue.Especially if you insist on eating, it's a good idea to have homework in advance.In preparation for infectious diseases, wear masks, wash your hands frequently, and maintain social distance.The new station was completed about three and a half years ago, shortly after the infectious disease.This is very impressive./ Shibuya is the most fashionable area in Tokyo, and you can see tourists from all over the world outside Shibuya Station, and foreigners with various faces gather here, knowing that Shibuya is one of the most important places in Tokyo.It can be. \ N, the fact that it is located on the daily commute to Yamanote Line, office workers and students, and the huge pedestrian flow has created the world -famous ""Shibuya Intersection"", the world's most crowded intersection.Take a picture. \ N If you want to feel the charm of the intersection, it's enough to come directly!It is rare to go to Primet, unless you need it.I have a dazzling to me in my 50s.The fact that it is connected to other systems and approaches the famous Hachiko sculpture and all its history, there is a small room that mentions all history.The place where the youngest young man and foreign travelers gather from Tokyo and JAPAN.In any case, the park has changed significantly, and construction such as reforms, renovation and commercial building is carried out.The village is ameling.There are many music relationships such as Crosa, violin, tower records, and HMVs.Despite the density of people on the streets, it is very systematic and safe.There are many things to do in Shibuya.It is a major traffic hub that acts as an important gateway to other areas of the city.Ginza Line is one of the oldest subway lines in Tokyo and passes through the most popular areas of the city, including Shibuya, Ginza, and Asakusa.The station is famous for its lively and lively atmosphere, and many commuters and tourists pass through the station door every day.Through the renovation work, the station will attract the attention of both commuters and tourists and will create a more vibrant atmosphere.The M -shaped roof adds architectural elegance and gives a future -oriented atmosphere.According to the commercial area, including the intersection of the omnidirectional crossroads, up to 3,000 people pass through the intersection during the traffic congestion time. ""In the impression that had no choice but to be redeveloped, it was certainly a new (especially dirty Ginja line platform), but there is no big change in the basic reverse structure.I feel embarrassed and walking. \ N I've also used Yamanote Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line, and Shintamagawa Line (Tokyu Denento), but because it is quite a metastatic, what is the comparison of myself, subtle…Even in January 2005 (2005), there seems to be a construction of the Yamanote Line Home.It may be a frame.A street with different expressions in the east, west and south of the station.Mark City, which has a home of Inokashira, is quite far.//TV's home in Shibuya, which comes from the spell, feels like the world of animation.It is a phase.The era of dirty images where young people of teenagers are torn around the street landscape are already part of the past. \ N \ n?.The streets of the Shin -gu are complicated and coexisting, and the distance of the coming culture is Shibuta.In the midst of laying, how does Shibuya change the end of the front?.. \ n \ n Choo Shin \ n Redevelopment Flow \ n \ n2018 Shibuya Stream \ N2019 Completed Shibuya Flask November \ N2019 Shibuya Scrambled Square Dong Dong -dong business \ n2019N \ n2019 The last day of the change of the groove of the Ginza Line on December 27, 2019 \ n → January 3, 2020, a bright and wide new home opening \ n2020 The home of Kyun and Shonan Shinjuku Line is Yamanote.Later and parallel deployment \ n \ n After this, the Sakuraoka District Development, Hachi Concert Square expanded, Shibuya Scramble Square Sindong Opening, and continued \ n and 2027.2023.4.22 Today, there were a lot of people on tours abroad.Are you from France ?????. \ N Unfamiliar people, including domestic groups, stopped or not a suica, but even if not, the JR Shibuya station, which has been narrowed around the ticket, has been overflowed and changed.I want you to approve Shinjuku Station?There is an impression that is more difficult to move than a station with a large area from the expensive to the depth. \ N This may be called a maze or dungeon.The surrounding buildings are also dried up and redeveloped.JR Sa -Kyo Line Home is transferred to the Yamanote Line, and Yamanote Line's home is a rich and abundant construction. \ NAnd I am worried. \ N because the passage changes a day, it is not meaningful to remember because it changes the passage of the station.It is between the underground of Togenzaka, between A4 and A5.Perhaps we arrive at someone who is struggling./Is there anything in Shibuya?It may be disgusted by the situation of the station or chaos, but there is a dream in this station \ nThere are huge crowds everywhere.For foreigners, the road guide is very easy to understand.The subway is very clean ./ Developed. \ N \ n2022 Temperature: 34 ° C \ n Tokyo corona breaks through 30,000 people!

I like the most in detail/Tokyu Station. Anyway, I have a good view.It is a street where you can enjoy a large generation, including the younger generation from the younger generation. \ N \ n is also the headquarters building of Rakuten.There are a number of shops, so it's a narrow area, but it's a distance that can be played for a day. \ N It is also a relatively rich area.It is, the express administration station \ n because of the rural and cucumber line boarding, it is convenient/transfer, and when you live in Mizo's mouth (even if the nearest station is Futako Shinji)When I went to Tokyu Motor School (now transferred to Tama) due to the acquisition of licenses, I used to use the station frequently by using free Song Young bus.I ate well, but I got off in 14 years in February 2014, but I was surprised to have a big change.Now, a contact bus to Haneda Airport or Narita Airport has also operated, which made it convenient (when we were living, we couldn't transfer to Shibuya, Oiachi, and Tama Plaza on the train).If you want to hear about the station, even if you politely masks, I responded with a smile that I knew, but in my turn, I was sad to say, ""Oh, so,"" in a very cold attitude. \ NI thought I would not rely on it./The role itself is excellent and the surrounding area is flourishing. \ N was in a very easy place to access and in Ganagawa.The bus was also easy to use because there is also a bus stop in the east and west, so if you are a little far from the station, there are many areas such as the macilling.Likewise, the station itself is very wide and there are many shops. \ N It is reliable because the home is relatively wide.It is active because the Tokyu Group is focusing on development after Shibuya Station.There is a long staircase that runs from one place to the groove. \ N The future problem is that the development of the Mansion development around Futakotamagawa continues for a long time.Despite the attractive village, it is a regretful station with chronic congestion and a meaningful station that has both advantages.Since there is one ticket, always walking the home with the road.You can see Tamagawa from home.The sunny day is a good view. \ N The bookstore of the ticket gate is convenient./ Can you be a Tokyo citizen, or the station of Kanagawa.Tamagawa is like a Tamagawa.\ n03 or 044 is also a big mount. \ n \ n is that.line.Chronic congestion has a lot of stability delays.It depends on the destination, but the improvement of the cucumbers to the cucumbers is quite advanced, so Tokyu seems to be using it as a bypass line.Tara…When it comes to, I think that the cucumbers are also an option.(Because Oi Machi is directing the cubic side of this home)/Station seems to be connected to the shopping mall.I want to go to play private.Tamagawa is magnificent at home.It's convenient for shopping.It relieves the feeling !! \ n \ n, but there is a lack of diversity and loses the star.Most of the stores and stores in this area only handle expensive designer items.Many people simply go there for Windows shopping.I'm getting a branding impression. \ N \ n is characterized by a nice company and facilities such as Rakuten and Tsubaya home appliances.I just knew that it was Futakotamagawa. \ N \ n I think it is a good city and station.If this review is helpful, if you can get it?If it is used in an elevator such as a stroller, if it is a rural tactic line, if you are a cucumber from Shibuya, you can take a car from Oiachi.On both sides, the transfer line transfer is more than Home Tamagawa, so you can go without the ticket gate.Takashi Maya is open to the north of the station, and there is an image of Hiso around the station and the route.In addition, the image has become stronger by the commercial facility, which is called ""Rise"", which has been redeveloped south of the station.There are many shops, but I think I will enjoy it in my own way, but on the other hand, the quiet appearance of the suburbs has disappeared.It's a very good place for the landscape, and the sunset from the groove is very clean.In the outside of the home, the rural tower line, in the middle of the cucumber line, the downhill grooves are both Mizonoguchi, the uphill is the left side of the Shibuya, and the right side is on the cucumber.Although it reaches only 15 minutes, it is a new quasi -level that rectifies at each station rather than a station in the morning of the morning's congestion rather than a diagram in March 2007, and is forced to board a five -train rather than waiting for the express.It has been in the form, but now it is increasing in addition to the commuter time. \ N next March, the express is newly established in the Oi Machi Line, so that it can go to less than 20 minutes to the end of the end of the end.You can also transfer to Odaiba and get close to Odaiba.Takashimaya, convenient for Rise and Toya shopping.The restaurant is relatively expensive.There are few places to eat lunch, no balance with shoppers, and always congested during the day.Shopping convenience. \ N There is a parking space for two -wheeled cars.The station of cucumbers.There are high buildings such as shopping malls, theaters, offices, and department stores.There are many shops, so convenient for shopping.There are many people near the station, so you can't do it so slow, but there are also calm places when you leave.It didn't overflow, but even if Takashi Maya opened, it did not change, but when I visited this land for a few years, the old prejudice collapsed greatly in a good sense, and the village was growing and modernized.It's a shock for me who is the closest role in front of Narujo Academy, but now it has become a big city that has been overwhelming in front of Narijo Academy. "", It is a clean and relatively easy role.Thank you very much./ The preparation of the illumination is excellent and the city is clean. \ N There are many stylish shops that can be calm and shopping. \ N It is a good place to walk.\ N The typhoon of the previous year was still overflowing. After that, I didn't think it would be flooded.It is good to see other commercial facilities in Takashimaya near the station. The restaurant is also an easy place to the luxurious place.It is no exaggeration to say that it is the second Shibuya station.It has developed due to redevelopment, but there is still one exit. I think it is inevitable because the river is close, but it is convenient if there is an exit in the other side or the center.It is very inconvenient. \ N If you do not use Futakota Magawa Station, I think it is better not to ride on the vehicle at the end.If you live in the streets of the street.

Toku, Nanbu Line, Yokosuka Line, and Sotetsu boarding grooves are too far (close to 10 minutes on foot ... especially in midsummer) \ n3.There are so many rides, which causes the delay every day \ n \ n has no limitations.You Cannot Transfer Here with a lot of notice. \ N Home is very familiar.15 minutes needed to transfer/Tokyu Toyoko and Meguro were the transfer stations of JR Nanbu Line, but in 2010, the Yokosuka Line Home opened.It was improved, and in the JR, it became a base for advocating the third place in Kanagawa.The Yokosuka Line has its own grooves and a slope that moves through the transit passage.If you are a transfer of Tokyu ~ Yokosuka Line, it is fast, and in the case of the Nanbu Line and the Yokosuka Line, Muka Wara Station is close.The inconvenience of the inconvenience is not felt. \ N \ n is becoming a capper over the surge of users, so the Yokosuka Line Home becomes a two -sided 2 -line, but the stop position is quite short.If you do not create an access to the ground (the reverse version of the weekday morning), people will focus quite a bit.It has become an uneasy structure.It is inevitable because the station itself is curved and cannot be held, but in order to promote the convenience of the northeastern part of the station (Kami Maruko), the opening of Tsunashima was installed at the end of 2023.This has made it easier to access the station in Tsunashima Gado, but the time is 7: 00 ~ 23: 00 time limit./ It is a bed town that has recently developed at once. \ N becomes a modern city of high -rise mansion.It is a terminal station that intersects with Yokosuka Line, Shinjuku Shonan Line, and Tokyu Toyoko Line.It takes time. \ N If you get off, there's a Musashi Kosci Toku Square and Gran Tree!Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, Nanbu Line, Tokyu Meguro Line, Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line is more than a Mita line and boards on the north and south line.Is very difficult to use.First of all, the ticket gate, called the Yokosuka pioneer, is very narrow, and the morning commute is a procession in the ticket gate.Transit on other routes is very far away and walks 4 ~ 500m on the same JR.In addition, there is a part where the passage is thin and the leader is not thought of, and the group of the people coming from the Yokosuka line and the group of the people coming from the Nanbu Line have no choice but to cross.Laugh enough to think that it would be good to put a signal.Didn't you think that the front was blocked?The groove is narrow, in the morning, and the matrix of the thin, narrow escalator continues to exit the moving sidewalk, so it is strange that the accident does not occur.Did you forget that the escalator's reverse driving accident occurred a few years ago in this station?There is a fan near the entrance.one.It's not that big.Is this fan circulating the air of long passage and cooling?I want to teach JR for that righteousness.Summer is foolish \ n \ n seems to have finally started making another home recently.It is not recommended to transfer from Yokosuka Line to Nanfan Line in this station.I am tired./\ N has a lot of transit because I have a lot of transfers because I intersect various crosses, Toyoko Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line. \ N \ N shopping mall is also nearby.Mutual transit time is around 5 minutes from home to home.When you head from JR to Tokyu, the guide marks are difficult to break on the way.Saitama High Speed Rail, JR Half, Yokosuka Line, Shonan Shinjuku Line, Odorikoho, Narita Express, and Sotetsu Line are on board, which can be directly limousine to Haneda Airport. \ NThere is no excellent access in the metropolitan area. \ N Also in front of the station is a large -scale store that is convenient for shopping such as Gran Tree Musashi Course, Tokyu Square, Lara Terrace Musashi Osugi, Hoodium Die, and Ito Yokado. \ NConvenient and easy -to -live street NO.1??/As you write down, the native line and Tokyu are no longer a different station on the Yokosuka Line (Shonan Shinjuku Line). \ NIt takes this. \ N \ n.

If you go to the airport on weekday morning, considering the flow of scary people who are scary on weekdays, you should have enough time to back up.Otherwise, it can be too late.The platform is also very wide, and even while waiting for the bus, Tokai and the Shinkansen will remain.!!!!!!/It became a convenient station.It is still around the time of Yokosuka Line Station or shopping mall.I miss you when there was only an empty place in the factory ground in the east.Is there any channel anyway ?? \ n \ n/Only the surface is getting clean, but it smells like sewage around the stairs.There are many users in Kanagawa, who are deliberately bumped into and followed with elbows.Kanagawa Hyunmin and Kawasaki are condensed./J.

The merit of the transfer at Tokyo Station is the Marunouchi Line and the Yamanote Line and Keihin Tohoku Line.On the contrary, if you try to use the station as much as possible, it's the farthest.If you want to delay a little bit of Rush Hour, you will be overflowing.Considering the safety surface, it was good to broaden it or divide the layer by downward line.Be careful as strollers and wheelchairs are really dangerous.And it takes about 7 to 10 minutes to transfer to southern lines and Toku..Anyone who says that there is no such distance for a favorite person who says that the station is crowded or not entering a nursery, it is good to live in the suburbs that take more than an hour from the city center for convenience and exchange.The transfer of Shonan Shinjuku Line? Nanfan Line) takes 10 minutes no matter how slowly quotes, so if you do not have enough time, you will be wings that will be transferred if you can't afford it.In addition, the liaison passage is a little narrow, and after the difference in transportation between the nanfire and the Yokosuka line. \ NI don't have the idea of Yoshi.The groove of the Yokosuka Line is far from the nanfire groove, and it takes about 10 minutes to move, so it can be called a different station.It is necessary to come out of the ticket gate, but it seems that many people walk out.There are elevators and escalators, but if you are uncomfortable in your body, you may be a bit painful.Each station is becoming a barrier -freeized, but I want you to think of users who transfer..Consider the weather, luggage, and walking speed.The shop is also faithful, and it is a placement that is easy to hear during commuting and commuting.There is a toks next to the garbage on the premises.There is no store on Yokosuka line.Walk anyway.In addition to that, the Sotetsu Line is careful.If you can ride here, the number of trains is less inconvenient, so you will go to the famous Haja and Yokohama National University.About 17 minutes.More than 30 minutes round trip. \ NIs it inevitable?\ n was commissioned by the ticket gate near Nishiguchi.(When you are wandering any ticket, there are most of the green window.) \ N \ n ??Doan and details ?? \ n?Spoiler Caution \ n \ n?

convenient./ Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line, JR Naval Line?As we cross, we can transfer immediately, but from the above route to the JR Yokosuka Line and Shonan Line, there are two things to walk through the nursery home or walk on the road in addition to the opening.(It takes about 10 minutes.) \ N is crowded wherever the residents and people are increasing by the construction of high -rise

NConvenience is convenient.All trains, including the express, stop.Uh, it is a high convenience station.Tokyu Toyoko Line, Meguro Line, JR Naval Line, Yokosuka Line can be arrived in Shonan Shinjuku Line and Yokohama in the province without transfers.The difficulty is Tokyu, the Yokosuka Line is far from the groove of the nanfather.It takes about 10 minutes to go through the home of the Nanbu.It is fast to walk from the south exit and the east exit.And I'm happy to be able to do a shop near the opening of the Yokosuka Line, but around the station, Grande Tree, Larateras, Toku Square and the usual shopping are faithful.If you like it, it's faster to walk to Muka Wara Station than to change it honestly.Tokyu is also on board Toyoko Line and Megu.In the rumor, you can hear that the

a person, and the walking smartphone is depressed.It is the fastest passing through the station.Nanfish home throughout the morning is a bit annoying in the morning, but the chestnut is a little annoying, but it is recommended to Kawasaki.I knew that the time did not change much, so I didn't use it./ The Musashi Course was very convenient because it was redeveloped, but it would not take 5 minutes even if the Ian Line Yokosuka Line home was far away.It is highly recommended to take time to take time.3 minutes transfer is never possible.10 minutes is just good if you walk.I think it's no longer recognized as a station other than the transfer station./ I stop in the basement. \ N has a supermarket and a restaurant in front of the station.I want the entrance to the Sinagawa side.?? \ N There is no need for a tunnel in the way. \ n Why don't you put a moving report??In the design stage, east of JR should be ordered in consideration of more efficiency and convenience. \ n is a waste.When you get off at the station, you can see only Tawa and rich in green.It's a good place to be convenient/livable because access is good, but because of this role, Yokosuka Line is now a regular of the congestion rate!(4th, 191% 2016) It takes more time to take more time, where all the users in the west are all closed!Besides, the paving of NEX or Shinjuku Line is so preferential to pass!Wherever you go, it's fast. \ N But JR's Yokosuka pioneer is almost 10 minutes one way from the dogs of the naengu line or Tokyu, so it's almost a different station.There are few shops that can be shopping cheaply.You can shop for shopping.In addition, considering the transfer with the Southern Line or Toyoko Line, it is dangerous because people are biased to the north of the home.It is because of the curve, and the 10 cars of Shonan Shinjuku stop in the south.The transit passage to the Nanbu Line is made to the shortest, but considering the transfer to the Toyoko line, it is a place

to Shin -Yo Kohama on the line, he was able to directly directly directly to Shinso Kohama by the Sotetsu liaison, so his relative status as a transfer station was inevitably down.It is one of the miscellaneous stations that are very crowded without commercial facilities around the station.I don't know why this structure is, but the rescue statue is very similar to JR Shibuya Station.Rotary is not maintained near the entrance of the station, and the bus stop is coming to the just before the station.That's why it's hard to understand for the first guest.You won't imagine that there is a matrix of the bus stop to the stairs of the station.Anyway, I think there are a lot of passengers who use Kikuna Station, but there are few guests who have been around.Express, each stop stop station.Ground station. \ N Yokohama line rapid, stop station.Overpass. \ N public transportation recommendation. \There is a toilet.Non -smoking. \ N Payment without cash. \ N Checking the need for use.A few years ago, JR's history was renovated and cleaned up, and the movement of JR was changed.(2). \ N The surrounding area is convenient for convenience stores, cafes, ramen houses, and Chinese shops in the east exit and the west exit.The luxury of the Yoko Line or the speed of the Yokohama Line stops! \ N will be available to the west exit of Tsurumi Station or Sinba Station! \ N\ n because the ticket gate (entrance) of the Toyoko line is at the end of the groove, it takes some time to lift.I think it's good to not be. \ N \ n1.5km, but if you have a dragon near the Yokohama Arena, it's quick to walk in chrysanthemums.It depends on the congestion of Shinyokohama Station.I don't think.It is a Kikuna station, and there is a ward office with Okurayama Station, so you can walk or bicycle.The use of Dotokyu Yoko Line is also close to Shibuya Station and Yokohama Station, and it is convenient because it stops because it stops.If you use the JR Yokohama line, you can easily go to Shinyokohama.Home doors are made and JR \ n is still a major station of JR and Tokyu. \ N Tokyu can move outside the floor near Yokohama, Moto Machi, and Chinese.It is often used for the transit of rectification and express, specialty, or express.// After the full number, the elevator is maintained for both the east and west.However, the access road is narrow and the traffic is high, so it is difficult to sing in the lane.The response of the station was not so good.Used after a long time.I think that the old side was comfortable.Would it be better to go uphill ?/ There are many convenient stations, but the station is narrow and shop in a small place.The in front of the station without a wind is really unfortunate.There is a lot more weightlifting, such as the facility.It is a major station of Toyoko Line in the transit station of and Toyoko, but it is a slightly changed station without large commercial facilities, but the restaurant is in front of the station.Obviously, I think it will be redeveloped someday. \ N \ n.The bus from Kikuna to the Tsurumi station is also coming out every 5 to 10 minutes.There are many mansions in Kikuna, and there are parks in the Kikuna 1-2, which is also the boundary of the cemetery next to you.In the daytime, the side of Shibuya has disappeared during the day, but each station stops in the station, and the expensive F -liner is being connected.The fuck train exists all day, but after the revision of the diamond, the fuck train is installed except for the day, and the transit passage with the Yokohama Line is easy to understand/JR Yokoha and Tokyu Toko Line.Both sides stop the train, such as rapid and express trains.There are some situations that continue to be above. \ N Is it impossible to do it anyway?A few years ago, the number was made calmly, especially the history of JR.The entrance position is the same. \ N The transfer is smarter, but Toyoko's side is so climbing and getting off again, but it is far away.Since the mouth is a one -way traffic, a preliminary investigation is required when you come by car.In addition to the trouble of traveling to the window several times without conveying the necessary matters at once, the reverse of the reverse was also unhappy.Even if I questioned the purchase of a regular pass, I received an early answer.I knew that nothing was solved even if I asked in this station.Reverse, pretend not to see!There can be no \ n \ n20-30 male guests entered the car, boarded in the car, and then settled. \ N \ n. \ n \Beautiful station in residential areas.On foot ??Under

station, so the platform and the stairs are narrow./The recent Yokohama line has become a new history. \ N I don't think it's inconvenient!Even though there was no train, I used the toilet comfortably to replace the children's diaper.The renewal of the Yokohama Line Home was not a barrier -free, but the transfer to the Toyoko line was smooth.But after the renewal, I feel as if the transfer line from Yokohama Line to Toyoko Line has worsened.Next year, Tokyu or Sotetsu will stop, but when the concert or soccer is held in Shin -Yo Kohama, the Yokohama Line is always crowded, so I want to put the home expansion, expansion, and staircase in sight.The history is new, but anyway, the narrow, old in front of the station, does not change forever.The decent shop is Ekima's bakery, tsutaya and Jonathan.There is no place for bus stops.The road is also rattled. \ N There's an incredible way to go to school.I used it in a decade to change to the line. \ N Is there any special idea ?/ ""In a scene from a celery wife, Mina's house is on a two -minute hill.""It is a station in Yokohama -si Gohoku -gu.All train species stop. \ N \ n home structure will be 3-6 lines with Yokohama line 1 and 2, and Toyoko line from JR. \ N ※ This example is Odawara Station (Odawara StationThere are JR and Odakyu) and Takao Station (JR and Keio).Elevators and escalators that connect the pattern and the home layer are newly established, and for barrier preferences.I responded.The rapid tank was passed until March 17 (Fri) 2006 (Hesse 18), but it became a rapid stop since the 18th (Sat) the next day.It was installed in the use of use from November 7 (Sun).The station is a smart home door.Sharkuna of the station building was also opened.In the line, you can make a complete access to the express and express train all day long, and you can transfer to each station stop.The same is true of Jiyu Gaoka Station.Some trains also have a dermal and fucking trains.The congestion is also alleviated. \ N \ N On the bus route, there are also a number of buses to JR Yokohama Station and the exit buses west of Tsurumi Station.Thrumi Station is a good way to use the bus.If it's a train, it is necessary to transfer to the Kei Hin Tohoku Line at Higashikanagawa Station. "", The worst station. \ N history is clean but \ nN like an old hot spring village. \ N It is also difficult to cross the two adults. I want to move. \ N I really want to move.Therefore, you must transfer to other trains (Tokyu Toyoko Line)./JR, the transit of the document is also very convenient?It was somewhat comfortable because I was able to do it, but because I created a useless four -story building history, the round trip of the elevator is slow and the flow of people is still dull.After the remarks of the transfer only after the disappearance of the transfer, it is a crowded line from the morning to the evening.The day is hell. On a rainy day, the line of guests waiting for a taxi bus from the east exit to the west is no longer a specialty.In particular, even though there are many users in the city, we still use small entrances to the era of construction and continue to use it.It seems to be pleasant, but it will be in this state for the time being unless it is barely denied the sense of being made on a narrow land.There are very few places where you can eat snacks such as major fast foods, such as terminal station classes, and there are no charms other than the station.Is very dangerous.The first person may be a bit embarrassed by the transfer of JR and Tokyu./ It has become easy to use in reverse, but Shinyokohama lines have long been a long -standing transfer with Tokyu Shibuya ??????I think it will continue for a while./\ N from Yokohama Line to Toyoko Line, Toyoko Line to Yokohama Line, and it has become a long and very uncomfortable station.There is an experience, but the plane has a waves that walk quickly.I can do it in other stations, but I think that \ n is longer and I can use it. \ N I appreciate it. \ NIt has been opened with an image with the same flat plaza, such as the waiting place.I think this is easy to know.There is no one before the JR Yokohama Line.And there's no charging ATM like Seven Bank, so it's really one.Besides, there are many things that have been broken.Therefore, if you are charged, it is recommended that you leave a transportation card from the case or pouch in advance./ Since there is a long business time, it is convenient to become a strange building to the groove.There is no bus terminal, but the restaurant is not as attractive as the chain store on the floor. \ N I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to ride if the Yokohama line is boring after 23:00.In transfer, even in the transfer, even if you live nearby, it is less convenient because it becomes strong every day.It is convenient to go to the wheelchair side or Shinyo Kohama because it is preferred as an elevator.However, the walking of the transfer is reformed, and the stairs are badly deployed.Local lawmakers claim that they have improved, but they are not user.JR Yokohama Line was opened in 2018 and became clean.Tokyu Toyoko Sun is dirty overall.In addition to the Tokyu Store, there is a kiosk, but the commercial facilities are weak, including the surrounding area.The development and urban plan for railway companies and local governments are weak.There is nothing, despite a vast person transfers every day.There is an advantage of using the Toyoko and Yokohama Lines nearby.JR Yokohama Line and Tokyu Toyoko Line cross the transportation and easy use.There is a Tokyu Store before the opening, and it is open from 7 am to 1 o'clock in the late night.In addition, if you walk for about 5 minutes, there are also Gohoku Library and Summit Store.I don't want to move. \ N \ n first, many things needed for life are gathered near the station.I think the nearest Olympics and Don Kihoote are huge as the same store.You can easily access Shinyokohama or Tresa Yokohama, La Lapo and Yokohama.In addition, various public facilities in Gohoku -gu are concentrated nearby (ward office, tax office, police station, Hello walk, etc.) \ n \ nIt is a benefit of Tokyu on a variety of routes, and you can only go to all places on the 23rd premises with only a transfer of the home face face of the Toyoko Line.Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ikebukuro, one with a bankruptcy.Kamata, Meguro, Ebisu, Roppongi, Yura Kucho, Ginza, Ueno, and Oji, you can go straight to Yokohama.In the Minatomiyamoto Motochi Motochi Town, there is a route bus from Shinyo Kohama, and there is also a transfer to Keikyu in Higashikanagawa.There are many hills around, and there is a limit of land use.There is no rotary or bus platform, no sidewalks, or narrow, will be difficult for children or old people.Recently, even though it is becoming a barrier -freeization of the station and becoming easier to use, it is necessary to be organized in the future.It is crowded with high probability.In the future, I think it will be resolved if Tokyu New Yokohama can be resolved, but it is a long time.You must use Shinkansen in Shinyokohama.It is very convenient because there is a Tokyu Store or Bakery where there is a Dokyu Store or a bakery.However, it is a surrounding environment that is not thought that the position is very bad and the station is stopped.Stopping is quite annoying, so you have to stop at the station.It is inconvenient to walk out to the entrance of the JR side (western exit).Like other Tokyu stations, redevelopment around the station is a difficult environment, so I think it is difficult for the station itself to develop.It is helpful to broadcast or mark it. \ N If you don't go to the ticket gate, it's unkind and unkind. \ N \ nN Anyway, I go up the stairs and go down and get out of the elderly and the kidney.☆ \ N Reverse of the ticket window ??

\ N If you do that, I think that the station was able to improve the level of Omiya station.In particular, the JR is narrow and packed soon.The box alone, the passage is unnecessarily long and the convenience is a regret./jr Kikuna has been renewed and improved, but the convenience of history is not so good.In particular, there is no dedicated elevator from the first floor and it is very difficult to understand because it is publicly used to be publicly used for the Tokyu Store.Because \ n is not convenient. \ N The barrier -free is improved.There is no. \ NJR's transfer of the Toku Line rises and falls, which takes more time than before.Tokyu's exit, Gu Tsunashima, the order of the bus waiting for the bus, and the morning will come to the second floor.I'm not thinking about Tokyu's documentary now, and I'm sorry to see it.I didn't like the toilet, and I didn't like the toilet in the aisle, but now it's very clean and easy to use!/I stopped this station a lot.It is mainly used for public transportation purposes.I went to some shops to buy sandwiches and drinks.For fun, I took a bicycle and walked around this station.But it's not a very interesting city.However, I remember that the mansion rent was quite good compared to Yokohama and Tokyo.I think it's a good place for those who commute to Yokohama or Tokyo.For example, it would be a good place to have a wife's work in Yokohama and her husband's workplace in the center of Tokyo.There is no noise at all, so it is a good place for those who want to live the same life as tomorrow.It will not be.I think it's good ~ \ N The morning around the station is surprisingly time -raining. \ N \ N Recently, there are a lot of ramen shops around Kikuna Station.It contains famous antiques.Strictly for the elderly.There is an elevator, but you need to increase the number.It's not a design that looks at the future society/Tokyu is becoming a barrier -free, but it's not slim, but it's cold because it's not right at all./Tokyu Toyoko's station stops most of the trains.In addition, JR's Yokohama line is also on board, so it is a passenger.Do not put it in the waves of a person who changes from the Toyoko line.In addition, JR is climbing and the groove is lowered, mystery structure.Fool./ It was a simple passage station.In addition, the stairs are narrower than the passengers, and it is difficult to know the contact with the documentary.I have no choice but to expect a reverse improvement work.There is a stamp in the opening of the Tokyu Line Kikuna Station.Because most of the stations were out of the dog, the liver and care were made and cleaned, but the route was bad.The transfer of JR and Tokyu Toyoko Line is also convenient \ n.

The Import Bus at the east exit of the Kikuna Station is a one -way traffic to the west exit of Tsumi Station through the old Tsunashima Gado.However, it is dangerous for the route bus to cross the Toyoko Line crossing, so it is not open and cannot be operated on time.This is because there is no plaza in front of Kikuna and cannot be done last time.In addition, the morning and evening in front of Kikuna Station is severe, and the crowds of Mt.

Yotsuya.The transfer in the ceramic line has been a little longer, but when I think about safety, I was convinced. \ N \ n 《Landscape Emphasis》 \ n200m near Yotsuya is delivered with a tight choice.It was a unique task of Tokyo, which was also a private landscape and traffic, and was also unique to Tokyo.Metro Togai, Yura Kucho, Nanho Kuyun Doi Oe Line/JR Central and Sobu Line, Tokyo Metro Toga Line, Nanbo Ku Line, Yuraku Cho Line, and Doei Subway.Before the construction of the history, the construction of the history was finished.The station was located in the opening of the transit by another subway from a pottery line underground statement.Anyway, if you can't respond, you can quit.It doesn't mean if you can't do a hospitality.There was information with the ventilation tower.It seems to be image of seeds and leaves, but the gap with the surrounding views is amazing./ The elevator was maintained from the Yuraku first line to the toza line.Good for wheelchairs and strollers.However, the barrier -free movement in the Hello Walk is bad.Once you get on the ground, it's hard to understand unnecessarily.There is no old and there is no elevator.There may be no enemies, but if there is, it may be Ibashi.I'm sorry for what I'm talking about, but I'm sorry for the useless level of story, but I think it was the case when Tosai Lee and the North and South Koreans were intersected.These two routes, Yuraku first, Oe -do, and JR Sobu Central Line are on board, but the transfer is never good.It has been known since ancient times that the party's inter -Korean and Yuraku -cho is a trip between the party's North -South and Yuraku Cho Seon, but it has been a consensus that it is inevitable that it is inevitable to walk around Otemachi along with the expansion of the transportation network.I did not.However, Idabashi seems to be a structure that feels more burdensome than the actual distance.It is the position of the torsion that all the lines are the position of the torsion, and there is no route that can be viewed not only in Fleming's law, but also in the position of the stain.The heart that is not a terminal will participate in it.On the premise that I made a mistake, I think that if you come out of MAX from the west exit of JR and try to ride the Oedo Line, you will feel a short station.It may be natural that even if you go to the ground, you will not be equipped with the station where you go right next to it and the direction of the route.And the sidewalk legs above can go to the coast (W) crossing the Ganda River, and the huge one that can choose a second route, but it may be a matching specialty.If you realize that the bridge, which is the name of the station under the staircase of the station, is too friendly and mumbling, you may be angry.By the way, the clear bridge from the west exit to the furniture Lajaka is the Usikore Bridge./JR Central and Sobu Line is a large terminal where the metrozai, Yura Kucho, Nagocu -seon and Doei Oe Line are boarding.JR has a groove in the curve, so the gap between the train and the groove is very good, but it is expected to be relieved soon because it is planned to move the home.It takes time to transfer. \ N Oedo Line is quite deep underground and the elevator is convenient but crowded.I am worried about the absence of guidance.The area around the station becomes quite new due to redevelopment, so there are many shops.There are always many users as members of society and students.There is an image like an Otemachi station. \ N \ n is convenient, but it takes about 10 minutes to transfer, so it may be better to have time.Some routes are transferred outside the ticket gate through the orange ticket gate.If you pass through the ticket gate other than orange, the first ride fee will be caught in double, so be careful.\ n is a big terminal, along the Yamanote line, which is an image of a large season.However, there is no such image at Idabashi Station. \ N on the ground with the central and small lines, the Tokyo Metro Zai Line, Nanbo Ku Line, Yuraku Cho Line, and Doei Oe Dodo.It is a long distance and an up -down on each route.It is dried and the residuals remain.It was so empty that people were simply dropped, and the place where the old man was trying to get off the train was the most empty and hard to think of it.If you were in the 3rd and 5th cars, you could get off near the opening of the east exit office, but nowAfter lowering the first car, walking over the groove for two minutes and reaching the ticket.Even if you have been using the east exit so far, there are some cases that are convenient to use the west exit depending on the destination.There is no complaint.Idabashi's opening side, I asked where the lost items are entrusted.So, if you go there, it was said that it was in the office in the Toy Zay Line, and if you look back at 450m, you can see the ceramic line before leaving the ticket gate of the ceramic line, our lost object, \ n \ nThere was no need to move near 1km WW \ N \ N There is a loss of lost items on the office of Tsuka East -West Line.\ n \ n from the beginning, please guide you from the beginning ... W/JR and the subway 4 -line transfer station is the next after the subway boarding, the transfer of the ceramic line is convenient in the \ NJR, but the other three lines are forced around the circumference.Receive \ n The groove of the ceramic line is to walk away from the other subway and walk for 3 minutes in the middle of the congestion.The most convenient is Nanboku Line. \ N Oedo Line is the deepest located far from the Bankyodo side.The sophisticated design of the subway station is a valuable value, especially the passage near Shinjuku -gu.Caution.In the case of transit, there is a ticket gate for the transfer. \ N \ n There are UNIQLO (outskittal) and Surber (in the ticket) on the subway premises.Previously, there was a big gap between the train and the house, but there is no current.Dangerous between grooves and trains.However, I think there are many opportunities to use because it is convenient for transfer.The stairs are hard :/kaws that the valuable tags bombed by the home can be seen at home! \ N I think it's also an ant to see this.I was nicely deceived by JR East Japan Station.The station has two exits, the east and the west, and the history of the east exit looks like an overpass due to the slopes around the station, and the history of the west exit is a cross -station building facing the Ushi Gome Bridge. \ N \ nThe station platform is an island platform with one side and two lines.The platform is located on a 300 -meter -wide curve track, so the interval between the train and the platform is large.Therefore, there are many facilities to remind passengers to remind passengers, such as warning lights that rotate in addition to in -vehicle announcements, and many speakers are installed at the platform.In January 2001, a passenger crash from Shin -Okubo Station on Yamanote Line (Passenger Crash from Sinokubo Station) was prepared under the platform.There was a tug of the train that returned from the start of the train.We have announced the reconstruction and improvement of.Reverse Square.The basic design will be held in mid -2014.The temporary historical building was opened on August 7, 2016, and the exit of the old west toward Ugome Bridge was closed.The two -sided home field is not Date./JR's home was relocated near Yotsuya, so the transfer with the subway has become uncomfortable.I, the receptionist?When I listened to the road, I didn't want to teach it, and it was corresponding to the chat.I felt like going somewhere.I feel like a city and I don't want to go back.There are subway ceramics, Oe -do, Yuraku first, and Nanfan Line, and there are many office buildings around Idabashi Higashi Guchi area when they come to the ground.\ n If you come to Lajaka, you can see a lot of restaurants and grocery stores.(B3 outlet) \ n \ n \ njr or subway can use various lines.JR is a central and small ship, but the subway is running revenge (Yuraku first, ceramic Lee, Oe -do, and North and South Korea), but it can be moved to various parts of Tokyo by radiation., Chiba → Nakano -only, trains and grooves are too big!!I think there are some people who are right, even if they are adults.Well, I've never drank here.Even if you open the window, 1200 ppm.Didn't the ventilation fan put the outside air?2021/12 10 AM\n\n metro good ventilation anywhere.500.If you try to buy a ticket of 2021/6/S Train, the 10 yen beads are blocked (10 yen, but it's about 10 yen).It's not a laugh. Tokyo Metro.What employees are you educating?/JR.It is a large underground and ground station that operates the inter -Korean, Ceramic Lee Sun -seon, Tokyo Metro Yuraku, Southern Line, Ceramic Lee, Doei Oe Line, and JR Zhu Line.There are several exits, so please explore carefully.(Less than 5 minutes)/JR's western exit history and home relocation.It is announced to use it, but it will be quite difficult in wheelchairs because it is a slope between the east exit and the west exit.The passage is narrowed by the installation of the elevator on the first contact passage, and the passage is narrowed again.As it is, it is possible to transfer in any ticket gate, but in the case of the ticket, the kip is recovered if it is not passed through the dedicated orange ticket machine, so be careful.It requires time./The western exit was renovated in 2016. \ N Sometimes you are wandering with the goal of furniture Lajaka, but if JR uses Devashi Station, you have to go to the west exit.At the west exit, the right hand is immediately furniture lasa Kashita intersection.On the other hand, Tokyo Osingung arrives quickly by leaving the east exit.no see.While waiting, I use a cell phone, which is addicted to smartphones.So I will try to enjoy the scenery without using it as much as possible.The Yura Kuku Line on the Ceramic Line comes out of the ticket gate, so be careful.And I walk a little.It becomes a city heaven/a station bent in a curved station.Rarely nationwide.The construction of the grooves that have been bent for many years are currently in progress near Ushi Gome Gomon and the home is in progress!Soon this rare sight will not be seen.There is no soap and the smell is a bit rare.However, the toilet of the ceramic line is new and very clean.Of course, soap included. \ N When I had lost an umbrella, I visited the ticket side or went to the parachute center and responded politely.I didn't expect much polite, so I kindly checked or alive with another parallel center.Thank you.The gap with the groove disappeared and the risk of falling was lost.Due to the rapid curve, the enemy was eliminated in Kant, so that it could be safely lifted.The previous groove remains a passage.!/It's okay for myself of a healthy person, but I thought it would be better to maintain more for those who are uncomfortable in the body.I think it's hard, but I think it's hard, but I would like to ask you.Thank you.There are so many humans who ignore the signal. \ N in front of the station will be a smoking area, but it's a cigarette permeability or a lot of butts. \ N From the perspective of manners.. \ N because there are so many ride routes, it may be a convenient place to build an office, but it is a place to visit for work./ Idabashi station in Nanboku Line has a full -size home door.Since Bashi Station has been added to the western exit ticket, \ n's train stops have been reviewed, so the distance between the east exit and \ n train is far away, so I wonder if it is necessary to review the stop location !!(If you don't go within a week)By the way, free fare when you go to catch loss \ n access to other stations is good, but the passage is long.There are a few antenna marks on the screen, but they can hardly communicate properly.The reverse building is even worse.I don't know other career because I'm a Docomo user, but anyway, Docomo is terrible.Since only ceramics are far away, you need attention when transferring.200m more than Shinjuku, and in a home without a crowd, I was able to rest and offer it.The uphill has an escalator, but there are many places without downhill.The Oedo Line is a bunch of streets (laughs) underground (laughs) underground.Two days later, I visited this place and the staff were very good at English.All items that are missing from the trains and stations on the subway line are sent here (in my opinion).I went into the building and told me about the lost things, my route, and the date of the train.It was really easy and impressive!I read that I can get 99% back when I lose things on a Japanese train on the Internet.I didn't believe it at first, but when I experienced it myself, I came to believe.The transfer of the subway is a distance, so I walk quite a bit.I am doing it.Both confectionery shops are located.N, especially the transfer from JR to Ibashi Station from Idabashi Station, it is very uncomfortable because it has to walk distance from the time of time. \ nIt's overwhelmingly close and fast) \ n \ n is a safe thing, but it's like a furniture Rajaka station rather than says Idabashi station.There is a \ n.

takes time to transfer.There are many restaurants for workers.It is vibrant.//jr and subway, so the transfer will be a bit of a transfer in the transfers.If the stroller goes to Takadanova, let's use the entrance of the JR side.Shinjukuna Shibuya is wide at the level (is it right?).If you fail the atmosphere, you will walk more than 500m (about 10 minutes).If you do not end in a word of `` Meet the legs ~ '', it is a waste of time and stamina if you do not have any exit, or any of a few grooves.There are also many restaurants that can be used./In the old days, there were no elevators heading

352,"The transfer distance is the subway station where the three routes of the three routes of Kim/Tokyo Metro Toga Lee and the three routes of the Doei Subway Shinjuku Line are boarding.In particular, Doei Shinjuku Line and Hanzo Mon Line can be accessible to the same groove and can be gently moved to the destination in the province.I think there are many installations of escalators and elevators.In the city center, because there is an imperial palace nearby, security is a good place for outstanding.In front of the station, there are many chain stores such as McDonald's, Hidakaya, Komome Buckwheat, and Royal Host & Starbucks.There are many famous facilities, such as martial arts and club halls.Yasukuni Shrine is convenient to exit 1.Especially in summer, I recommend using this station because it is very hot because there is no shade on the Yasukuni Shrine., It's a bit wandering. \ N, but it's convenient to use a lot of lines that can be used.The removal of the wall of the stupid wall has made the transfer smooth.Women's toilet procession.There were about 20 people lined up. \ N Yasukuni Shrine has a few toilets, so please use the first participant.The toilet near the stall was especially on the back of the stalls, so it was difficult to find it.When transfer, you can transfer without going through the ticket.This is rare in the transfer between Doe and Metro. \ N original, there was a wall between the Doei Shinjuku Line and the Tokyo Metro Hanzo Mon Line, so we could not transfer without the ticket.Innose, a former governor of Innose, called the wall of the fool as a symbol of discomfort.It was possible./ ""Subway club Sita Station \ n \ n first, I thought of it from the Doei Shinjuku Line. \ N"" close!
