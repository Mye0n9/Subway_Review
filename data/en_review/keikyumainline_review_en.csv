exit is convenient./ The station is a strange uncle.I think it's the first time, but at least the station of the station of Tokyo Metro Nagata Machi can say that.In the same station, you can go to Magome, Gotanda, and Asakusa, so it's very convenient, but it was only uncomfortable because there was no escalator going home from the ticket gate.There are many fucks because the branch station of the Keiku Line, this is the starting point of the Keikyu, and the barrier prefation is delayed.There is a gateway station.I was worried that I couldn't see the main cavity nearby.In the basement of the Daiichi Keihin National Route, the home width was narrowed, and the home door was quickly installed.There are two tickets at the north and southern ends of the station.The toilets are all outside the ticket gate, and on the north side, there is a toilet (a private room for the kidneyers and men and women).Doei Asakusa Line and Keikyu Main Station. \ N \ N The Terminal Station on the Keikyu

Line.Gotanda and Nishima Game are transferred to the Nishima Game's Nishima Gome in this station.Home in the cue line. \ N There are many people waiting for Nishima Gomo Me on the groove, so if you don't care about it, you will fall on the track.However, because the Keiku Line arrives, it is good at 30 seconds to arrive, so I first won the Nishimago Me, ride a home passenger, and then it is not

is about half (laughs).It is the headquarters of Keikyu, but it is the starting station of the Keikyu Main Line, but it seems to be transferred to Minatomirai suddenly.This station itself is also a new expansion, so it seems to be born again,I look forward to the street.However, somehow, the gateway station stops, and I want to do it in Shinsen Take and Takana and Sendakesa.For this reason, there are many trains that are folded at this station, and there are many transfers to Nishima Game and Sinagawa..For this reason, I couldn't name Izumi Dacettage on the new role of the Yamanote line

convenient./ I don't have much distance from the ground to the basement, and I think it would be convenient to use the APA hotel on the distant side of Haneda Airport.Considering the hotel situation around Sinagawa Station, the Senkakuji area may be surprisingly convenient.\ N It is a very fast convenience in a short time stop.When the diamonds are so bad that the driving intervals in Nishimagome are empty, there is a lot of people with a narrow home.It is a Doyoung subway used in taxes, but it is a dangerous state for the situation.In order to take a taxi, it is necessary to go to the street,

the entrance from the ground and the southeast, you cannot arrive at the station., I walk a little bit, but I survive. \ N seems to be difficult to congestion because the groove is narrow.Three and 4 platforms are all passed through the east center of Tokyo and are connected via Keisei Line and Narita Sky Access/Hokuso Line.In this station, you can go to Haneda Airport and Narita Airport.You can

have been mentioned as Kabukina, doll premature ejaculation, television's era, and books, but the present world runs through the world at the moment and is unstable.I think there is something that cannot be erased.I think that's what it is important for the future of Japan.In particular, if you take a train marked with ""Nishima Gome"", you will move in the other direction from Haneda Airport

11,11,게이큐카마타 역,3.6,"It is a big train station with Haneda.Check it properly and board it.In fact, the side called Kamata Fortress is famous! \ N From the place called the fortress, the structure of the station is three -story structure, the first floor is the opening floor, the home with the second floor, the third floor descends,And long grooves with 18 nutrients, the history from the outside is a huge fortress!! \ n, and this fortress is complicated anyway, and the groove is 2 sides and 4 lines, but even 1 ~ 6 lines, and basically the second floor is sinagawa, and the third floor is the side of Yokohama, but the slightly difficult one is the train on the airport.It is open from both the 2nd and 3rd floors.In Announcement, the train of the station stops passes through the details of everything, so it is omitted because it is not perfect. \ NI think Kamata Station is definitely a chaos station in Kanto!/It is a transfer station to Haneda Airport.It is about 700m away from JR and Tokyu Kamata Station, but the mall continues, so if you look at the store, you don't feel far away.On the mountain side of Kamata, there are large commercial facilities and Yuzawaya, so if you proceed to the arcade shopping mall, you can go to the swamps.It is easy to live because it is rich in Keikyu Line and can go to Yokohama in the province./ Keikyu Kamata Station (Keikuka Tocha Eki) is the station of Kamata Yoncho, Tokyo, Tokyo.am.The reverse number is KK11. \ N \ N high -end station with 6 lines of 6 lines.It is a branching point of the main and airport line.It is a three-story structure that places the gate floor (4-6 lines) on the first floor, the second floor (4-6 lines), and the downhill groove (1-3 lines) on the third floor.On the second and third floors, the same shape's grooves (later) overlap up and down.It has a tinnitus of ""Kamata Fortress"" from this profound structure [20].The northern part of the theory also spans Kamata Sancome beyond Kusu Kawa, but there is no ticket gate on the north side.On the Haneda Airport, to Yokohama at Haneda Airport, and the 4th line, Haneda Airport in Yokohama and Sinagawa at Haneda Airport will stop.After branching with the main line, the interval between the Sithsus crossing near the side of the side of the side is in the form of a single line parallel (to this part).Sithsus Crossing is in this position because line 1 and 4 are located on different floors and cannot be installed right near them.In addition, when the Sinagawa is reversed when the operation is united, the train of the Keikyu Kamata from Yokohama arrives in the 4th line, moves towards Villa, and then crosses the Sithsus crossing, proceeds, proceeds.Change the direction to enter the first line, change the direction again, and return to Yokohama.There is.On the outside of the groove of 2 and 5 lines, there is a passing line of 3 and 6 lines, allowing for an evacuation (evacuation).In addition, when the winning line 2 is passed through line 3, it is necessary to pass the 6th line after the kick from the 5th line.Line 5 was already completed at the time of 2010, but did not disclose the public. \ N \ n because it is the structure as described above, the groove itself has a length of 18 nutrients [21]. \ N \ nBroadcasting is only used by Sayaka Ohara on the 1st and 4th lines.It is also known as the ""Kamata Fortress"", also known as a huge building.Anyway, this station is one of the very transit and user crying since ancient times.In any case, the destination is a complex strict, and it is impossible to guide the transit guide app.I think it is less likely to remove it with a uniform one -rate \ n on the second floor.After the poem, I rode it from Sinagawa Station, but I could sit. \ N The next day, the next day of the airport was 10,000 won.Yokohama), the lower layer is uphill (sinagawa).The side of the Haneda Airport is a time because the grooves change from Sinagawa and Yokohama.There is a so -called 'Kamaba Line initiative' heading to Haneda Airport through Dang Station.Retreat ?? \ N Anyway, it is a herbal station divided into Haneda Airport, Yokohama (Kawasaki), and Sinagawa.14…/JR Kamata Station and Keikyu Kamathata Station is too far and there is 800 meters.Immediately after I was on Keikyu, \ n \ n went to Kamata Kamata in a lifetime accident, and from Kamata to JR Kamata \ n. \ n \ n infant was hell.There is no. \ N \ n. \ n \ nine is not soft, and I don't think I will walk.The main line of the Keikyu Line and the airport line intersect, and the number of users, including transit passengers.Recently, the station is a three -story high -cost structure of the home with a ticket gate on the first floor, and the home with the second floor is a three -story high structure.I think it is difficult to know for unfamiliar users, such as stopping on the 4th line of the second floor.There are also many people who make a mistake in the second and third floors separately.I saw a lot of foreigners walking around.Since the premises are not enough, I think that if the number of travelers from provinces or abroad increases, there will be more people who cry out by transfer.It seems to be called Yokohama. \ N \ n seems to be called Kamata Fortress, but I don't know if it's on the station. \ NI want to walk in front of the station when there is time. \ N \ nIs it easy to develop, but is it difficult to have a slight distance from JR Gamata Station.N It is very cute. Since the station of the high -priced two -story structure, such as the fortress at 400m, the main branch is Sinagawa, so it is a switch bag in Yokohama and Kawasaki.The runner waiting for the Daiichi Keihin crossing, which was once diverged to Haneda Airport as a ground disconnection, was Pungmul City of Hakone reversal, but now I can no longer see.\ N \ n3 layers are downhill grooves and the second floor is uphill. \ N home is large and long anyway.\ n Vending vending machines are one in the distance. \ n There is one ticket gate.It is convenient to know. \ N \ n If you look outside the airport.many.I'm looking forward to it in the future.In 2019, Sumikogurashi collaborated. \ N It is a delicious and transformed on the second floor to the third floor.I think that convenience is getting worse than the old days.In the stamp rally, you can get sewing dolls or magnets by pressing the stamps such as Kamata Station or Haneda Airport Station.In addition, Sumiko Kurashi train is also running. \ N Yes, even if this is, the groove is divided into the second floor, depending on the thin direction, or the same groove.??It was.It was a very interesting station!/It is a special production called a three -story terminal, and it was the only [switchback method] in the big city.Nothing is different from something else, and you can go to Yokohama, Zhi, Kanazawa, and YRP Nobi on the east of the Gaysey train and Kitaso Railway.The structure of the station has been changed since it has become a continuous three -dimensional relationship between Shinbaba and Kawasaki and the airport line.Since it is a two -layer structure (3rd floor, 3rd floor), it is required to be particularly careful when transferring at the party station.※ For example, the Nicino Airport Line, Right, Odori, Aomori, Aomori, Amanovashi, Sinagawa, and Doei subway are required to be transferred from Dang Station.(Stopping Airport Express is in the direction of Yokohama. Sinagawa passes through a pleasant special operation.)?/It is convenient wherever you go, especially Haneda Airport?An indispensable system that is indispensable to access ?????Sun, it's easier to use ??When China still has a high fare of the airport, I have a holiday outing pass.(laugh)…/Sumiko Kurashi 10th Anniversary Collaboration Event is being held.We sell products with Seven Eleven on the premises.When I stopped at 10/29, the product sold was almost sold out when it was 10/31./Years) Recalled to Kamata Station.There is a sense of tax in the older Kamathatha, the former Kamata Station.N, other, convenience stores, bakery, bars, Talis, Tenya, bookstore Kumazawa, etc. can be used immediately.If you have a big baggage such as a travel bag, the taxi is convenient.. \ n \ N Seven Eleven before the ticket is good, and sometimes a Keikyu product is lined up in front of the store.Although it was a station that caused a congestion, the transportation around the surrounding area is very soft, so \ N I think that even if this age is very successful.It is also recommended because it is quite Otsu to walk towards the JR Gamata Station.I think it's a station. \ N If you are on the 3F, there is a difficult place to get off at 2F.I think it's on the side. \ N ah ah, if you want to get down on the lower floor, you have to go to the center near Yokohama ???I completely forget about the precautions.I was very sad. \ N Mr. \ N will be kind to me, but I'm familiar with a specific dragon, a person who is heading to Haneda Airport, a person who is heading to the Daejeon -gu Industrial Center PIO.\ NJR Camata Station is accumulating various commercial facilities and accommodations (10 minutes on foot, 600 ~ 700m), and there are also shopping streets at the west exit of this station.On the rainy days of the Lian deck, you can go and come and go without a lot of wet.This is. \ N \ N The driver, which was divided into a crossword such as a crossword, is a plus point.. \ n \ n This extremely long and complex structure is a negative point for users who actually use the station to the home by transferring the station. \ nFor local residents who have been dating, the passage of airport pleasure is nothing other than betrayal.\ n \ n's best problem is that this ""Kamata Fortress"" is not in advance of the news of the passage of airports in the local area.It was used for months. \ N When I was moving to the 9th camp of the former director of the apartment, it was an 8 -minute walk from the nearest station, but now the nearest station is a 30 -minute walk from Umeya Shiki Station and a 40 -minute walk.It is used to use the Keikyu Bus.// Before entering the ticket gate, let's check the destination on the entire billboard. \ N ② There are three destinations.On the left side of the bulletin board, please find a train from Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Haneda.Since the destination varies depending on the floor, 【Absolute】 is confirmed before riding!The groove of the bulletin board is riding. \ N ④ The Haneda airport is the right side of the second floor.Home No. 1 to Haneda Airport Home No. 4, there is a train that arrives from the airport due to the nature of the switch white light, so be careful! \ NOn the second floor, we arrive from Kanagawa and divide it into Umeya Shiki/Heiwajima/Sinagawa and Haneda.The number of grooves is different, so if you are not used to it, it will be a little awkward.It is definitely convenient for passing through the Haneda Airport train, but if you try to transfer or transfer in Keikyu Kamata, it becomes incredibly complicated.Listening to the announcement of the car in the car or the home of the home.This is the secret that does not fail in Keikyu.But there were so many trains from the airport, and in addition, it was fast when I thought I got a riding speed.There is such a convenient place.Tokyo is a great place.N, especially the second line is really difficult. \ N Is it not possible to transfer in the same home by train or the worst.Either Tokyo leads to an accessible airport. \ N shopping, food, accommodation.It is all over and all is equipped.Express) The 5th line is usually the train Sinagawa, the 6th line is Sinagawa, Izumi Dakge, Doei Asakusa Line, and other railroads, the 3rd floor is Haneda Airport, Yokohama, and the second line is usually the train Yokohama, 3Since the turning line is complicated with Misaki Kuchi and Yokohama, it is necessary to check with the LED display, and the bus stop other than the kamatha station is in front of Daiichi Gehin, who crosses the ticket gate and crosses the press bridge on the left.The train of the suspension of the party passes through, ”he said.I can't figure it out completely. \ N \ n There is only one advantage.It is said to be very convenient for those who say that they can only be used by passing through Kamata Station.You can go to Haneda Airport at once at the Asaku Line and go to Haneda Airport without a transfer in the Sinsko.The opposite is so. \ N \ n.However, there are more disadvantages.The grooves are divided into two and three floors and are ""disconnected parallel"", which is why it is strangely long.Each train is located in Yokohama, Sinagawa, and Haneda Airport.\ n \ n wants to connect to a car in Kamata, or want to transfer to the train from Sinawa to the train from Haneda Airport.There is only a labyrinth for those who say. \ N \ n There is only one solution.First of all, if you want to get off at the Keikyu Kamata Station and use the transfer, \ n “I want to transfer to ○○ from Keikyu Kamata Station, but how can I move when I arrive?\ N, ""I ask the station in the ride station.""/The local country is the best in the country.It is a branch of the Haneda Airport Line, and it is a difficult rescue and indication that is unknown to tourists and foreigners..The two doors have no doors in this position.Although there are signs such as, there is no vehicle or door mark on the front light bulletin board, so I don't know where it would be good at all.Some people may say it's okay, but even if you are waiting for it, you will suddenly change due to delay. \ N ★I don't know at all.It is a sudden in -house announcement, and if it is a line opposite, if the layer changes, the stairs are moved to the folklore \ n ★ The same home, but there are other turns (5 and 6 lines) before and after.It lines.Therefore, if you need a dash of 100 meters in the transfer (laughs) \ n ★ It is difficult to know, but there is no station in the home other than the rush..As a transit station at Haneda Airport, which is used by tourists at home and abroad, at least, at least, even if the station or the minimum is not provided, it is an unkindness station that is not a story.There is a house far away.The supermarket feels narrow, but the product is faithful. \ N The restaurant is rich in variety and not difficult./ It is difficult to understand if you do not check the place for ordinary passengers, but it is called the first popular for 'Cheol -chan' enthusiasts..Anyway, get off and experience it calmly./ I always confuse signs and platforms here.Even the Google map is not displayed where to go.I live near Joshiki Station, but I went to Keikyu Kawasaki because of the ordinary train.The station where the fast stops.& Haneda Airport?/The train signs here can be very confusing. \ N \ n Some of the platforms show multiple destinations (e.g. Platform 4).As a foreigner, I thought I mean each train stopped on the platform to these two.But not.This means that the train to different destinations uses the same platform.If you don't check the billboard, you can also board the wrong train!If you go to the airport in a hurry, the situation may be bad.The airport express that stops at each airport line is the 4th line on the second floor.This 4th line is a song that requires attention because the agency of the Japanese airport is also stopped at this home.Since it is currently being an event, I think this sign (see photo) is listed.It is recommended to check the guide marks of the station.!If you leave Haneda Airport, some of them stop at Keikyu Kamata Station, but the airport pleasant will not stay in \ n Keikyu Kamata Station, so be careful!!!!!!!!!! \ N approach melody is a dream!/It's been a long time since I transferred to Keikyu Kamata

station.Do not.It was late due to an accident.Therefore, it is better not to make a mistake.700m is quite spicy.If you go wrong, it will take time to transfer, and even \ n is far away.It's a station to challenge after preparing in advance.Did you become a specialty of Hakone reversal?Recently, it has a high -priced line, so it doesn't matter.Haneda Airport, Keikyu Kawasaki, Yokohama, Kami Oka, Kanazawa Bundle, Zizi Hayama, Ura?Bassi, Asakusa, Osiah) Makinohara, Inba Japan Medical School) is convenient?It is recommended to ride a train so as not to be transferred.The exterior feels like you interfere with the near future.I wandered away without knowing how to ride./It is a good station to use the Keikyu Line.In particular, this station is connected to Haneda Airport.If you are coming from downtown Tokyo, you should change the train to the airport here.If you need a hotel for early flight the next day, it is recommended to use this nearby hotel.You can access the airport.You can also enjoy great food.Enjoy!But now there is no cross -crossing wooden. \ N The street landscape is once a crowded pub streets across JR Gamata Station, but now it is a completely calm atmosphere.Of course, as you get closer to JR in the stone, you will see a kamata.Since there were a lot of airport officials around Kaikyu, there was a different atmosphere than Kamata, but I think it was more clean by the recent redevelopment.It seems to be more exciting because it seems to be able to open it nearby.There are two types of escalators going to 2F and going directly to 3F's grooves.I was embarrassed because I had to ride after checking on the bulletin board in advance.It is recommended to be used in time.In addition, there is a distance from JR and Tokyu Kamatha Station.Since the front is the distance of the basic base workers, the security is not good, the burger that was in the morning..The groove is a two -story building, and the grooves for each station stop by the Yokohama side are difficult to know, but there is a polite annunability.There are main ships and Haneda ships at the station/Keihin express station that is easy to use and easy to use.It is about 10

strange structure with a three -dimensional cross with 2F/3F.It was called the body, but there was no contact line on Yokohama on the airport line, but before the establishment of a direct train between Yokohama and Haneda Airport on October 12, 2002. \ nIf you still have only one line in the east, and if you are in the Yokohama, you still have a direct train from Yokohama, which is said to

crossroads and the airport line and the direct communication of the airport line between Omori -cho and Villa / Color Colors.It is a three -story building of the ground history, and the second floor is determined by the upper line and the top floor as a descending line, but this is a single parallel structure that allows you to smoothly direct the direct train of Yokova.When you leave the station and arrive at the parallel with the upper and lower lines, you will enter the original down line, and the upstream train will drive a complex driving to enter upstream. \ NOn May 16, 2010, the high
