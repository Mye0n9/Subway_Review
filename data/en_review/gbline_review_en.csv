If the Gyeongbu Line is the aorta of the railroad, it is the heart of the Korean railroad.Due to the opening, when the Yongsan Station was changed to the main departure station, the members of the National Assembly took place.The Korea Railroad Corporation announced that it is a regular train and Seoul Station is a hiring of Seoul Station, and it is a god of gods.Only a few trains stay. \ N \ n.It is the cities and terms of these big trunk railroads, so there are about 75 million people on the annual and urban railway of about 3.0 million people per year.History \ n \ n was opened as a Namdaemun station in Seoul with the opening of the Seoul city center in Gyeongin Line in the days of Namdaemun Station.The station name of Gyeongseong Station (Seoul Station) was held by Seodaemun Station (Lung Station) until 1905, and Gyeongseong Station (Seoul Station) was officially exists until the station was changed to Seodaemun Station and Namdaemun Station was changed to Gyeongseong Station in 1923.\ N \ n's historical site was originally a place where Manchocheon flowed, and the river was reinforced to the side of the Gyeongbu Line, and the river landfilled and reinforced. \ N \ n Gyeongseong Station \ n \ nIn other words, the old Seoul Station history is an exotic building of the Neo Renaissance style, which was completed in September 1925, and used stone, reinforced concrete, and steel structure.Originally, the plan was to promote the Japanese imperialism by setting up a similar scale to Tokyo Station, but due to the lack of damage in the country due to the Great Kanto earthquake, it was reduced to one -quarter of the original plan.So I thought I would expand later from the beginning.In fact, compared to Tokyo Station, it was built on a dwarf scale. \ n \ n The first floor of the history is used as a waiting room (the past expression of the room) and a stationary space, and the second half of the second floor is the first Korean peninsula (except the restaurant in the hotel).It was used as a high -end tea room, which also simulated the function of Tokyo Station.Tokyo Station was also used as a hotel, and the same was true of the old Busan Station.Anyway, at the time, it was a rare spot in Paldo, Chosun, and it appeared in the ideal novel wings.Designed by the old Busan station building) Seoul Station was considered to have imitated Amsterdam Station or Tokyo Station similarly, but in reality, Switzerland's old Lucerne station was found to be a model.The construction of the Shimizu Construction in Japan was in charge of \ n \ n's past Lucerne history, which was almost similar to Seoul's history, but it was difficult to know the relevance because it was collapsed by fire in 1971 and only the entrance of the building was restored.In fact, the official visited Seoul Station to restore the history of Lucerne after the fire.Amsterdam-Tokyo-Seoul Station is similar in terms of using red bricks on the exterior, constructing space in the building, and built as a passing form rather than a general station in Europe.In 1947, the Ministry of Liberation was expelled from the Korean Peninsula in 1947, and the name of the station was changed from Gyeongseong Station to Seoul Station.In the case, the radical business plans that broke the Seoul Station and its surrounding area at all, and included the railroads to rebuild and rebuild, were reported to the president and publicly open to the general public.As described in the previous article, it has been destroyed for various reasons, and it will be reduced to the construction of Seoul Station, which is the predecessor of Seoul, 7017. \ n \ n1987 The Korean Honorary Group has invested with the Railroad Authority and private companies.We set up Cheongnyangni history in Seoul to start the construction of private history.
