transfer side.There are buckwheat shops and Gi Kuni shops in Nakano Station, so how about stopping you when you're hungry?There are many people anyway.If you change the route on the center line, the rent will be lowered and recommended.If you get out of the station, there is a clean apartment, but it's probably high.It's a waste.No, it's definitely a rule.If so, don't leave people at the window

prohibit streets.The escalator is somewhat crowded and lacking.Shinjuku Line is chronic, so I think that the response of the station is bad.The commuting time zone does not see the groove of the

of lack of employees and securing safety.There are security guards, but at least, the time zone is a part -time job, a temporary staff, shouldn't it be completed?This is something that can be said in the station, but if you think from the perspective of lifesaving and customer, I think it should be considered more seriously.There are also physical disabilities and blind customers, so you can do it

enemies, but if there is, it may be Ibashi.I'm sorry for what I'm talking about, but I'm sorry for the useless level of story, but I think it was the case when Tosai Lee and the North and South

expansion of the transportation network.I did not.However, Idabashi seems to be a structure that feels more burdensome than the actual distance.It is the position of the torsion that all the lines are the position of the torsion, and there is no route that can be viewed not only in Fleming's law, but also in the position of the stain.The heart that is not a terminal will participate in it.On the premise that I made a mistake, I think that if you come out of MAX from the west exit of JR and try to ride the Oedo Line, you will feel a short station.It may be natural that even if you go to the ground, you will not be equipped with the station where you go right next to it and the direction of the route.And the sidewalk legs above can go to the coast (W) crossing the Ganda River, and the huge one that can choose a second route, but it may be a matching specialty.If you realize that the bridge, which is the name of the station under the staircase of the station, is too friendly and

Nagocu -seon and Doei Oe Line are boarding.JR has a groove in the curve, so the gap between the train and the groove is very good, but it is expected to be relieved soon because it is planned to move the home.It takes time to transfer. \ N Oedo Line is quite deep underground and the elevator is convenient but crowded.I am worried about the absence of guidance.The area around the station becomes quite new due to redevelopment, so there are many shops.There are always many users as members of society and students.There is an image like an Otemachi station. \ N \ n is convenient, but it takes about 10 minutes to transfer, so it may be better to have time.Some routes are transferred outside the ticket gate through the orange ticket gate.If you pass through the ticket gate other than orange,

5th cars, you could get off near the opening of the east exit office, but nowAfter lowering the first car, walking over the groove for two minutes and reaching the ticket.Even if you have been using the east exit so far, there are some cases that are convenient to use the west exit depending on the destination.There is no complaint.Idabashi's opening side, I asked where the lost items are

I want you to go for free when shopping.I think the warrior may end even if you don't go around.It is easier to pass a passage than Chiba, but it may be unreasonable when the ticket is needed because it is not confirming that there was a vending machine in this passage.In that case, you need more than 5 minutes of transfer time. \ N \ n So, if you are heading towards the Toy Zay in the Numa, it is better to use a direct train when the time is correct. \ N \ nThe passage is closed according to the time zone. \ N \ n The rapids of the cow line will not stop. \ N Musashino line is changed by the train, so be careful.Since the Tokyo line has been 10th line, the staircase of the 10th line is right, but I left the 11th line opposite and waited 20 minutes later (t^t).I want to complain about Google's route guide, but I want you to make it easier to know because it's a good transfer of the train.Is it quite the top of the number of elevations in Chiba Prefecture?The convenience of the Metro Toga Line, the JR Sobu Line, and the Musashi Line is connected.In the morning and evening rush, the chin seems to be broken.So I use a motorcycle.There is a station called Funabashi, Higashi Funabashi, and Minami Funabashi, and it is perfect if Bukhunabashi and Shinhu Nabashi are formed.I'm very sorry, but the security is never good. \ N If you talk to a friend at the main field at night, you throw a cigarette from afar, and if you play it, you came and shouted.There is only a tavern at night at night, and there is no place to play properly at night.And the driver is generally rough. \ N Now it's not on this street, but it's never recommended for a woman who lives alone.If you get used to JR, there is a risk of burning.There is an image of the transfer.On the road to the gate of the ticket gate and the Togai Sun Home, there was an old stall of Yakitori.Is it still?There is a cafe or a bookstore on the opening of the front and doba high -speed railway.It's 500m away, so it's a good idea to take a 10 -minute time to take a short time crossing the signal of the road and walking on a narrow sidewalk. \ N \ nIf it's not for a walking purpose, it's less than half of the time to take a time at the Shimos or Kayama Station next to it. \ N \ nThere are many people who want to spend transportation, or those who have to walk inevitably.??.There are also many users from morning to night and are quite lively.Evening -night, if the train stops a little, it becomes a lot of human beings and a difficult thing.9-10, 11-12 \ n If the home is high and the wind is strong in winter…It is cold. \ N.
