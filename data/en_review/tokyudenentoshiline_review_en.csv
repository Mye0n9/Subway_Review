I like the most in detail/Tokyu Station. Anyway, I have a good view.It is a street where you can enjoy a large generation, including the younger generation from the younger generation. \ N \ n is also the headquarters building of Rakuten.There are a number of shops, so it's a narrow area, but it's a distance that can be played for a day. \ N It is also a relatively rich area.It is, the express administration station \ n because of the rural and cucumber line boarding, it is convenient/transfer, and when you live in Mizo's mouth (even if the nearest station is Futako Shinji)When I went to Tokyu Motor School (now transferred to Tama) due to the acquisition of licenses, I used to use the station frequently by using free Song Young bus.I ate well, but I got off in 14 years in February 2014, but I was surprised to have a big change.Now, a contact bus to Haneda Airport or Narita Airport has also operated, which made it convenient (when we were living, we couldn't transfer to Shibuya, Oiachi, and Tama Plaza on the train).If you want to hear about the station, even if you politely masks, I responded with a smile that I knew, but in my turn, I was sad to say, ""Oh, so,"" in a very cold attitude. \ NI thought I would not rely on it./The role itself is excellent and the surrounding area is flourishing. \ N was in a very easy place to access and in Ganagawa.The bus was also easy to use because there is also a bus stop in the east and west, so if you are a little far from the station, there are many areas such as the macilling.Likewise, the station itself is very wide and there are many shops. \ N It is reliable because the home is relatively wide.It is active because the Tokyu Group is focusing on development after Shibuya Station.There is a long staircase that runs from one place to the groove. \ N The future problem is that the development of the Mansion development around Futakotamagawa continues for a long time.Despite the attractive village, it is a regretful station with chronic congestion and a meaningful station that has both advantages.Since there is one ticket, always walking the home with the road.You can see Tamagawa from home.The sunny day is a good view. \ N The bookstore of the ticket gate is convenient./ Can you be a Tokyo citizen, or the station of Kanagawa.Tamagawa is like a Tamagawa.\ n03 or 044 is also a big mount. \ n \ n is that.line.Chronic congestion has a lot of stability delays.It depends on the destination, but the improvement of the cucumbers to the cucumbers is quite advanced, so Tokyu seems to be using it as a bypass line.Tara…When it comes to, I think that the cucumbers are also an option.(Because Oi Machi is directing the cubic side of this home)/Station seems to be connected to the shopping mall.I want to go to play private.Tamagawa is magnificent at home.It's convenient for shopping.It relieves the feeling !! \ n \ n, but there is a lack of diversity and loses the star.Most of the stores and stores in this area only handle expensive designer items.Many people simply go there for Windows shopping.I'm getting a branding impression. \ N \ n is characterized by a nice company and facilities such as Rakuten and Tsubaya home appliances.I just knew that it was Futakotamagawa. \ N \ n I think it is a good city and station.If this review is helpful, if you can get it?If it is used in an elevator such as a stroller, if it is a rural tactic line, if you are a cucumber from Shibuya, you can take a car from Oiachi.On both sides, the transfer line transfer is more than Home Tamagawa, so you can go without the ticket gate.Takashi Maya is open to the north of the station, and there is an image of Hiso around the station and the route.In addition, the image has become stronger by the commercial facility, which is called ""Rise"", which has been redeveloped south of the station.There are many shops, but I think I will enjoy it in my own way, but on the other hand, the quiet appearance of the suburbs has disappeared.It's a very good place for the landscape, and the sunset from the groove is very clean.In the outside of the home, the rural tower line, in the middle of the cucumber line, the downhill grooves are both Mizonoguchi, the uphill is the left side of the Shibuya, and the right side is on the cucumber.Although it reaches only 15 minutes, it is a new quasi -level that rectifies at each station rather than a station in the morning of the morning's congestion rather than a diagram in March 2007, and is forced to board a five -train rather than waiting for the express.It has been in the form, but now it is increasing in addition to the commuter time. \ N next March, the express is newly established in the Oi Machi Line, so that it can go to less than 20 minutes to the end of the end of the end.You can also transfer to Odaiba and get close to Odaiba.Takashimaya, convenient for Rise and Toya shopping.The restaurant is relatively expensive.There are few places to eat lunch, no balance with shoppers, and always congested during the day.Shopping convenience. \ N There is a parking space for two -wheeled cars.The station of cucumbers.There are high buildings such as shopping malls, theaters, offices, and department stores.There are many shops, so convenient for shopping.There are many people near the station, so you can't do it so slow, but there are also calm places when you leave.It didn't overflow, but even if Takashi Maya opened, it did not change, but when I visited this land for a few years, the old prejudice collapsed greatly in a good sense, and the village was growing and modernized.It's a shock for me who is the closest role in front of Narujo Academy, but now it has become a big city that has been overwhelming in front of Narijo Academy.

After that, I didn't think it would be flooded.It is good to see other commercial facilities in Takashimaya near the station. The restaurant is also an easy place to the luxurious place.It is no exaggeration to say that it is the second Shibuya station.It has developed due to redevelopment, but there is still one exit. I think it is inevitable because the river is close, but it is convenient if there is an exit in the other side or the center.It is very inconvenient. \ N If you do not use Futakota Magawa Station, I think it is better not to ride on the vehicle at the end.If you live in the streets of the street. If you live in the rural tower line, you will be amazed at the transformation of Tama Pla./ Tamagawa is visible and clean at the home of the station.And there is no illumi, so it will be a bit lonely. \ N is a little sorry for the closing time in the square.. \ N Anyway, it's a big annoying god \ n and the groove is really far from the mouth of the grooves.Tsutaya Bookstore is a very interesting place for all generations to visit.If you are home on time, you can shop/very good memories.I experienced the accuracy of the Japanese observatory.During the fireworks that day, the observatory was expected to rain at 4 pm.But at noon the sun shone brightly.The sky was good at 3 pm.But about 3:30 pm, the situation began to change (if you watched SF movies, you'll know better.)
