"
579," This station is a state -of -the -art station, and according to my experience, there is always a train waiting for departure.There is not so many people now.It is clear that there is a very large plan for the area, and the MTA ensures that it can accommodate the future crowds.Unlike the bathroom tiles, it looks very modern and clean because of the beautifully designed murals decoded on the wall.Do not misunderstand.There is nothing opposite to classical construction, but it feels like the entire bathroom tile installation work that has been in progress for decades is in a huge toilet.7, which ends here, is only hopeful of the crowds that will be flocked to the surrounding development area./ This is a new station (relatively) with modern buildings, but if you look closely, you can wear signs and maintenance defects (eg escalator ceiling)).

The upper mezzanine has a toilet, the lower mezzanine has a lot of space, and there is a display on the wall.As with expectations for future crowds, the platform level is very wide.The whole station is also bright.(The only reason for the four stars is that leaks have been reported around the station ... but it is expected to be because the station was built near the river.)The last station of the route .../Amazing subway station.This is a good way to go west.The Jarvis Center is on the corner and offers a breathtaking view of the highline.A must -see attraction.If you are in Grand Central or Time Square, take 7 here.I was a little surprised by the big escalator.It is interesting to ride a long and deep escalator.The depth is 109 feet.It is also interesting that the elevator in the station is also inclined.Please check if you are on your own.You can use the convention center and the new HUDSON YARDS area under construction.ㅋㅋㅋ It was fun to surf the subway by riding the trains 7 times from Hudson Yard 34.In fact, it's really a good breeze/Thanks to this new station, it's very close to the Megabus platform.There is also a new station, and the station premises are kept clean, and even many works of art are available.The escalator is quite long, but you can sit comfortably and ride comfortably.One of the most popular places is the Highline Park, which is currently extending to 34th Street. "

Sar Helleu.When the commuters complained that the sky was upside down (it was drawn as if looking down from the top), it was insisted to be intentional (perhaps I don't want to admit the error)..The interior is so cool and there are many places to eat in the restaurant.The ceiling was probably my favorite part!/That details and plans went into this station.Don't just run around, but spend time to enjoy architecture and build.The overall structure is well and it is not bad to transfer with other trains.The memory of this station is that you have to get a LIRR ticket in order not to use the LIRR ticket after a month.I tried to deal with the recent news of the huge ticket gate, but again, it is closer to the systematic problem of NYC that has flowed into the MTA rather than the MTA's fault./ I had great expectations for the New York subway, but I used this transportation system.Is completely disaster.First of all, the train was frequently delayed, and when the next train would arrive, I waited for a long time at the platform without any information.The air conditioning of some trains was not noticeable because it was not present or too weak.On the hot summer day, the train was like a sauna, and by the time I arrived at my destination, my sweat was soaked.I have seen many times that rats wander around the track, and some stations have a terrible smell.The lack of cleanliness felt that it was unstable and not safe.As a tourist, I knew it was difficult to explore the system and often found that I was lost or riding a wrong train.It became more difficult to find a way because of the lack of clear signs and announcements.Frequent delays, overcrowded trains, lack of air conditioning, dirty stations, and confusing maps have been an unpleasant and stressful experience.I will not recommend this transportation system to anyone.Clean the station because there are many passengers on weekends and labor days.I'm very glad to see this station and it's fortunate to be stored .../The beautiful thing is that cleanliness, information services and security are all in your service, clarifying inquiries and modifying the path.Is bad and there's no way to improve it.The platform is small and not safe.Train 7 is relatively new, clean and much cleaner than other routes.The Central Terminal (GCT, Grand Central Station [N 2] or simply called Grand Central) is a commuter train terminal located in 42st Street in Manhattan Midtown, New York City and Park Avenue.Grand Central connects the northern part of New York to the southern part of the Harlem, Hudson, and New HAVEN routes of Metro-North Railroad.In addition, it is connected to the Long Island Railroad through the Grand Central Madison station, a 16-acre (65,000m2) rail terminal under the Metro-North station built from 2007 to 2023.The terminal is also connected to New York City.Grand Central? 42nd Street Ride the subway.The terminal is the second -largest train station in North America, following the New York Penn Station.Borjar design contains numerous works of art.Grand Central Terminal is one of the top 10 tourist attractions in the world.In 2018, 21.6 million visitors visited except for train and subway passengers. [3]The central hall of the terminal is often used as a meeting place, especially on movies and TVs.The Grand Central Terminal has a variety of shops and food stores, including high -end restaurants, bars, food halls and grocery markets.The building is also famous for libraries, event halls, tennis clubs, control centers, railroad offices, and underground power plants.It was named after that name.It also operated in New York, New Haven, Heartford Rail and later in New York's Central Railway.Opened in 1913, the terminal was built on two previous sites with a similar name, the first of which was built in 1871.The Grand Central Terminal operated a train between cities until 1991, when AMTRAK began the train route through a nearby PENN station. "
614,"grand Central has 48 acres (19 ha) and has 44 platforms more than any other railway station in the world.All of the platforms in the basement offer 30 tracks at the upper level and 26 tracks at the lower level.There are 67 tracks, including railroads and siding.Of these, 43 lines are used for passenger services and the remaining 24 tracks are used for train storage. [N 3]Pizza is expensiveOnly that value is certain.It's an icon with a reason, and I've been using Grand Central for 35 years so far, and it's still the best station throughout New York..Despite a lot of activities, it is a beautiful place./ As a visitor, I've always read this impressive station until I step into this impressive station!I was really happy to feel immersed in the magnificence and magnificent atmosphere of this amazing role.It's much better than anything I've seen or visited!There is an easy access entrance.There is also a ""Help Desk"" with a very friendly employee.There is a public toilet, but it's a bit difficult to find.But if it's a historic landmark, it's a place that you shouldn't miss when you come to New York!There are many people in time, but the train is on time/""It is a symbolic station that visitors must see. It is a trunk station and a subway stop.Don't forget to look around, this place is an amazing building and is intervaled to keep people's flow best.It is a genius place.The food hall has a wide choice, and despite many people, the space is fast.It appears. "", Grand Central Station !!It has changed a lot over the last 30 years !!30 years ago?I didn't like to go there.I will never bring my child there !!Now ... clean, family -friendly and easy to explore !!And ... I also had a daughter !!/Inside the station and terminals, there are well -signed signs that guide shops, shops, views, places, and means of transportation in Grand Central.I will remind you.Do not forget the campbell apartments!/Except for the lobby of the ground floor, the lobby of the subway is really old, dirty and sometimes dangerous./ Many people prefer to take pre -wedding photos here.Very clean and well -managed.Officials are very helpful and provide all the necessary information.After 4 o'clock in the morning, the station is very crowded, so if you want to see the station, plan to go in the afternoon.Typical NYC tourists' necessities!In addition, there is a shuttle to Times Square.A beautiful building with many history.After the building was built, you can imagine everyone there, and the image of a TV show and movie will come to mind while walking around.Hey, the 42nd area has changed!The subway has a very necessary task.But the area did not list the charm.I enjoy walking the streets.There are still many tourists around.Yellow taxi, busy walking people .... I'm New York or Friends!There are many entrances and outlets, so you can find convenient exit in most destinations in the area.The construction is underway with minimal interruptions to improve the subway main entrance.

615, It is a good place to take pictures of New York City.It helped. 
616," They also have a lot of security police and packs shots and assault rifles.I also saw a lot of secret services throughout the street, in front of the Trump Tower and the entire subway terminal.Wow is security anywhere.I like to know that I am safer while I am visiting this beautiful state. "
617," We have a direction in the guide desk in the terminal several times and every time they get lost, they can easily guide us in the right direction in the terminal.It was.We also asked one of the people who worked in the terminal to go back to the New Jersey River road.The gentleman took us to the ticket office to guide the process and told me that I would like to know what to do next time, showing how to find a river on the ticket and the bus we need.It was 158 and the terminal we needed was 202.Then he showed how to buy three tickets with one deal without purchasing a ticket separately.Very good people working in this terminal.Thank you very much for the help we gave us while we were there.thank youI will contact you again.

643,"New York City Hall Subway Station.There's nothing special, and it's a good idea to get off here to cross the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.My favorite train is the R142A subway with the JESSCIA advertisement.I hope that the MTA will record this fact and re -publish the original announcement in the Lexington Avenue Line, which started NYC and all human life in the city.As an African -American, it is worth $ 2.90 for subway fare, so pay the fee.Because it provides value.If you go to other states, there is no transportation.Or maybe I'm always looking at 777, or it's just lucky.I liked this place!It is easy to walk from Brooklyn to New York, and the subway can be easily reached nearby.The view is really cool!Everyone must take this walk!/It's a big train station for those who want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, but it's more suitable for locals who have to go to the shopping area.Either way, it's a train station that doesn't work more than moving from one place to another.It is recommended to take the tennis because the promenade is long.It is a street.For example, a group of elephants pass by to prove that it is reliable and not fraud.It was created before the existence of a car.You must remember that there is a bicycle path (respect it and the bike passes at full force).Even if the lock is visible, it cannot be left, a fine is imposed, and the lock is very likely to be lost the next day.It is easy to cross the bridge or take the subway to Manhattan.no see.There is a faded magnificence.If you stay on the subway, you can see when it will change from downtown to uptown.Do not be afraid of leaving all passengers.It is embarrassing that the bottom line is not so magnificent.It is functional but nothing special.It is very convenient to maintain a better sign for the exit and the beautiful tiles that have seen a better time (a few years ago).I took a taxi before, but the driver was lost in the wrong position.The subway saves our lives and taxis are very expensive.I want to go back to Manhattan later.It's much more convenient than Staton Island.It usually runs on time/I was in Brooklyn to see my sister, it was a great day.It was crowded with people, but it did not reduce my great experience.I recommend visiting this symbolic place and keeping it clean, and I believe it is forbidden to put a lock on the leg fence.Everything seems to be fine.Brooklyn's beautiful panoramic..It is recommended to walk in the direction of the Brooklyn Bridge downtown by the subway.It was built in 1909.It is natural without modern tools.It would have been adversity.Beautiful building.The interior is empty.Line 4 and Line 6 are running under it.They no longer build these buildings.This place is convenient to go anywhere.The World Trade is about 5-6 blocks from Chinatown and Little Italy./ The City Hall Loop, which was opened in 1104, was once a luxurious terminal station used by about 600 passengers a day.Passenger trips through this station have been suspended after 40 years due to the rapid increase in the New York population.Today you can visit the station only at a very specific time of a year.At one time, it was a popular spot where locals and travelers could see the complex designs of the past, but they were closed in the mid -20th century.In addition, all trains on Line 6 form the end of this place, and the direction is changed to the opposite direction.But what most people don't know is that if Line 6 continues to ride, the track passes through the old and abandoned city hall.It is very interesting but not much to see the lights of the train rarely shine the old platform, and the light upstairs is coming through the stairs that go up to the city hall.It's very fun to see, but it's not very good to take a picture./If you take train 6, which is the last station, keep boarding the train.why?You can meet beautiful and historical viewing.I think it was closed in the 20s.If you pass it, train 6 will appear again on the uptown platform.The new station is beautiful.I like the iron cable around the entrance of the city hall, but keep the interval in mind when getting on the train and getting off.The station is a bit bent./I highly recommend it to see the clean and old city hall stop after the train of Line 6 continued to ride around.It's just changing the direction, and you can get off at the station in the north direction.Climbing the stairs is full of noisy atmosphere.The park had a great crowd and performers who are doing all kinds of acts.The choices to go and the direction to go are somewhat overwhelming, but the stairs were the first step of the journey across the Brooklyn Bridge.If you are going to travel, please prepare.If the weather is good, there will be a lot of people who take a walk.
