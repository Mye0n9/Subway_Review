0," It is a very fast convenience in a short time stop.When the diamonds are so bad that the driving intervals in Nishimagome are empty, there is a lot of people with a narrow home.It is a Doyoung subway used in taxes, but it is a dangerous state for the situation.In order to take a taxi, it is necessary to go to the street, so I don't think it is a station that endures practical at this time.Some trains of the Margotes are also on the side of the Izumi Dake Sinagawa Station.Wheelchair is at the entrance of Mita Station.The groove is only staircase in the pattern.Maintenance with the Yamanote Line New Station!/Because there is only one side of the elevator and the escalator, the worst is for those who have a substitute from Haneda Airport or those who are uncomfortable. "
1," are old.I know that I like the analog of Japanese analog, but for people who are uncomfortable and foreigners from Haneda Airport, the batch of transit or the equipment is the worst./GOOGLE map, but the A1 exit is marked in the southeast, but it is closed because it is under construction.There is no sign during the closing of the exit, so if you find the entrance from the ground and the southeast, you cannot arrive at the station., I walk a little bit, but I survive. "
2," station is quite old and poor.There are many ointments of Akayoshisa Temple, and it is also a deep temple for Akayoshi.When Akaho was born and raised, I thought that when I was three, I thought I would endure once so that I would forget time in the television drama or movie of the loyalty.Doctors were quietly sleeping and felt that they were still in Japan.So far, Kabukina, doll premature ejaculation, television drama,…Please be careful when you visit Tokyo and go to Haneda Airport.In particular, if you take a train marked with ""Nishima Gome"", we will move in the other direction from Haneda Airport.I only passed through the details/a few o'clock, but I started the exterior with a transfer with JR. "
3," I am using the Asakusa Line, but Daiichi Kei's Tamachi Station exit has a lot of ""down the stairs"" to the gate, which is frustrated when you are tired.In addition, "
4," Currently, the toilet is under construction, and more frustrated…?? "
5,"20200913 The A6 exit with the ""coming down"" is closed because of the nearby building construction.It is good to improve, but ... "
6,"20200919 The toilet renovation seems to be over and it is very beautiful?The A5 · A6 exit has been closed since September 13, 2020, according to the reconstruction of the melee building.※ At the time of March 2021/Daiichi Kei Hin's response is the worst. "
7,"I found a bakery on Google, but I was disappointed. "
8,b2 outlets are not recommended if possible. 
9," because we are stopping the escalator to resolve congestion, the heat that climbs the stairs is rather confronted, so it is very dangerous.When my eyes stopped suddenly, it seemed to fall out of balance and fell dangerously.Anyway, I endured it, but if you are trying to get rid of people behind you…"
10, lacks career guidance 
11," \There are some difficult places, so it's definitely transfers to ride the flow of others than to investigate themselves.. "
12," But when it is a holiday, it is a terrible reduction in humans, becoming a very quiet distance, and it is one of the rare streets.n "
13, will be full of drunkenness at night-! 
14," irony, it's because you have never seen such a severe station. "
15," is crowded in peak time./ JR Higashi, Doei, Tokyo Metro, Yurikamome, which is famous for being messed up by the expansion of the surrounding buildings. "
16," You're in detail at your work, so why do you make a mistake.I'm here, but if you're a refund, you don't need that issue. "
17, I hate Sinbashi because of you^_^
18,"2019 -I had a very bad experience at Sinbashi Station as the entire train network in Tokyo was stagnant.I was trapped inside the train and was trapped for almost an hour and a half after passing through Sinbashi.The railroad authorities failed to manage passenger traffic.The train was too crowded and the platform was crowded, so passengers could not get off the train.That day no one could step on the railroad platform.In the end, the authorities had to take a ticket to manage the entry traffic and open the exit gate./ The station connected to various lines with subway or Yurika Mome JR.When you come out of the station, the celery man's pub is unfolded.It is convenient for Yurika Momero to be convenient.there is.It is the role of the mind.The west exit of the station is SL, and the headquarters building in the east is lively.It is a station with detailed/JR, subway, Yurika Mome and various routes.It is often reflected in TV interviews.It was easier to pass by the ticket gate because it was better than before.In the opposite, there is a Shiodomeguchi of the Yurika Mome and the transfer.It is a pilgrimage spot where the main character is drawn./ Akihabara moved from Sinbashi./ If there is only a coffee shop counter and a small table seat, for one person.It's more than 500 yen of coffee unit price.This is a two and a half -month -and -a -month declaration of emergency.There are many withdrawals..The general opinion of Japan is Sinbashi Station./ It is a village with many foreigners./ Tokaido Main, Yamanote Line, Keihin Dohoku Line and Ginja Line, and Doei Subway Station.It's always a lively./When I go to the exhibition on the Tokyo Big Site, I go to Yurika Momo with a transfer transfer.Finding the locker is difficult to pick up because of the small lockers and wide, so it is difficult to pick up (> _ <) \It's so good and beautiful.Doei Subway Asakusa Line and Yurika Mega."
19," is convenient because it is good..If you ask for alternative transportation at Yurika Mome Shinbashi Station, you will be rejected as a target except for a regular pass or a ticket.If you ask for a reason, ""If you are in prepaid, like a regular pass or ticket, you can transport it, but the watermelon and Pasmo are out of the target because they charge and ride the money.""""ha?Wouldn't it be different from the regular authority to charge and ride in advance? ”Such rules are inevitable, but if the train stops due to a clear maintenance of a signal confirmation, not an accident in a rush, and a passenger suffering from the lungs, it is said that it is crowded.Home walking is also common, and there will be many salarymen who are commuting without buying regular passes.Anyway, I want to respond to the passenger first.How did you make excuses,It is your responsibility to stop the car.Passengers are victims.In it, the stroller family of aggressive, unusual, and horizontal patterns is very noticeable without following the rules.You can drop the reputation of another stroller that identifies common sense."
20," is a transit guide on a smartphone.Muslims think it's hard to find halal food here.The air conditioner is full and the wind is very cool.Help it and the attitude is bad when I speak.I think it's not suitable for hospitality.It is also in the subway and Yurika Momo, and this is also in Asakusa and Ariake. "
21," is also relatively valid as a waiting place, but there is also a complex place.The response and attitude of the reversal of the pattern are so bad, especially the staff of Midori's window, it was difficult because the story did not work./Multiple JR Lines, Subway 2 routes, Yurika Momaga Street, and Yurikamome are famous for the city of office workers.It is also close to the Shiodome station where the Oedo Line passes. "
22," using this summer vacation, I moved to the old Shinbashi stop!I felt bad at around 22 o'clock, and I was resting in the bathroom, and I realized that it would close.It's been two hours, where did you go?I said I was resting in the bathroom because I felt bad, but I was forced to collect 200 yen side by side with theories that I don't know about 2 hours. "
23,"I couldn't say anything strongly, but it was unreasonable. "
24," \I think you are using it./It is a station where you can go directly to Kabukija.I want to use an exit close to work, but I can only open it from 7 o'clock.This time I didn't install the escalator.As it is scattered in other word -of -mouth, I can only see the garbage that seems to be well adopted.There's a lot of severe stations so far (laughs) "
25," near Sinbashi Hagi and Dongguk.In the old days, it was close to Tokyo Station, which seems to have been a tent of the OTC, and it is a few minutes from Ginza Station.Obviously there is an elevator going to the platform 2 to go to Narita Airport.Eventually, I climbed the stairs with a heavy travel bag and arrived on the platform, but eventually missed the train, I had to wait 30 minutes to take the next train, and it took more time to go to the airport.It was scheduled to arrive at Narita Airport at 10:30 am, but it was delayed to 11:30 am because it missed the train for 2 minutes. "
26," I ate my friends, but the dough is not delicious.Among them, the cream was not delicious. I bought a "
27, I asked at the window and asked if I asked for a bad response.. ”I said a word for a hard place. 
28," How to use it is very convenient?This is difficult.?/Indeed, Do -young.The structure of the station is severe."
29," I received it as a family after returning home, but the custard taste is thin and the caramel is the taste of poison (● Kuta ●)."
30, is also because Takashi Maya is burdened with construction costs in the construction of the station. 
31, was emptyed by 30cm from the railing.. 
32, is embarrassed by Japanese people.It was one of the stations I visited in August.I tried to abuse it as much as possible because I had a three -day pass for Doei/Tokyo.The other time I was on the charity was when I went to Ginza Station or Shinbashi Station. 
33,"2.Narita Airport direction: A4 exit/employee's response is excellent but stationIt feels an old feeling./ Because it has a torque, it is convenient because it collapses while waiting for the fast.It's a station./Fat staff wearing glasses has a lot of racism./ It takes time to transfer./ It's a quiet role./?/It's too far to go to the opposite home."
34,There is no benefit. 
35," Asakusabashi Station has a facility near Osiage, and the first day of Keikyu, the early morning all morning, was completed until many years ago.But clean and dirty time…The most severe thing was home garbage (a variety of big bags ... The courage of washing detergent…) is in the private room toilet ,,,.Then, the former person's dirt has not flowed, or vomiting, no toilet paper, (women's toilet).Saying not (it was stolen by someone ...) was very shocked...(Crying)/JR Sobu Line (Each Station) and the station of the Asakusa Line of the Doe Subway.The station of "
36,"jr was attacked by a radical attack in the `` simultaneous guerrilla case '' on November 29, 60 (1985).It is incapable of operating. "
37,It is the largest blot of the century this century.It is not good to have a significant lungs because of the broken lines.
38," Anyway, this station is only deformed./ It is an impossible and impossible traditional good station.!(◎ _ ◎;) "
39," is a pity that Midori's window has disappeared./ Asakusa is the station next to two, and the Asakusa bridge.When you leave the station, the doll's doll shop is side -by -side, but the ninjocho is next to two.This is the Asakusa Bridge.Of course, the minimum tool is equipped, but the leather has a bad quality or color as a whole, and I have been caught in some shops as if the fake and recycled leather of Kodoban is thick.Asakusa's leather shop is completely good.The elevator that can be used is also a structure that suffers quite a bit of a weak foot because of the limited location.It is a city that loses morality. "
40," also smells like cigarettes in the ground smoking in Asakusa.It cannot be recommended for medicinal performers.I want you to demolish the smoking.In particular, if you want to get to the east exit, you will have to climb the stairs to enter the station and go to the home to Shinjuku, so you have to use the stairs again.??Here you can go to the famous attraction Sensoji!Since the elevator was possible recently, it would be easy to use, and it would be helpful for women with a stroller with a child.Because I came out, if I explained the work to Mr. Reverse, I was in Van Gire from the beginning.Yes. "
41," We ask for the amendment of the law by Gukju.If you walk up, the steel is designed with a clean curve.There are many.The transit passengers do not appear in the village, so the restaurant is difficult, but the sentence level is high.However, there is a high difference between Asakusa and Sobu Line, and it is necessary to move in the horizontal direction, so convenience cannot be appreciated.I don't think that I want to go to food and shopping on the Asakusa bridge, and I don't think that I want to go to food and shopping.Akihabara cannot arrive unless he changes the elevator of the home and the ticket layer.The toilet for the disabled may be intentionally contaminated and cannot be used.The toilet water in the women's toilet does not come out.Although it is expensive, the distance is strange in any route, so there is always a tendency to be late immediately after the kick.The recent elevator is also bothersome than walking, rather than a mystery structure from the second floor.The station is not very motivated.There are two extremely inconveniences/exits that have been made when they are high -priced decades ago, but if this is the first time, it is difficult for the elderly to have only a large staircase because the elevator or escalator is on the subway.The wheelchair has an elevator at the opposite entrance, but the road under the station is narrow, so the JR is not for the guest, but from the administration.Despite the many things, the east exit is the station of the JR Sobu Line, which is not installed even an elevator or escalator. "
42," Do not work?`` This, this is not Asakusa !! '', which is familiar with the familiar Asakusa Bridge "
43," ※ I'll add it later../ If you have a lot of luggage !!!!Be careful when using this station. There is no elevator inside the station.If you make a mistake, your life will change.It is the end that the cost is low, but it is not possible to carry the goods.. "
44, It will be insufficient to live. 
45,"I realize that I send a line.I think this is why this line is noisy.In addition, because there is a Dowe subway, the escalator only installs only the uphill, so it takes a long time and tired.The transfer with the Doei Oedo Line must also go to the ground.It's far away.I was in a hurry to Haneda Airport, but I was quite embarrassed.If you come out on the ground and transfer, I hope you change your name.""Minami in Gurama"".The route of the Oedo Line and the Asakusa Line is also subtle (Rose and Magenta ...)/It is difficult to transfer with Oedo Line.However, because of that, once you come to the ground and walk a lot of streets, it is very inconvenient to think about the transfer.However, there are times when treasures are sleeping in the scenery from the nearby Gobashi or the Lawson near the Oe Line A5 Exit, so if you have time, the other person is a comment.There is a Kuramade station, it is a transit station, but it feels like it comes out and down on the ground, and it does not seem to be connected to the underground road./ [Street memo] "
46," I bought a 3 -day subway pass, and I finally understanded a little after the day's transfer experience.You should be able to see it, and if you don't know, ask the passengers or station attendants on the same train! ""It is not very convenient to move from one to the other on the Asaku Line.So is the equipment old?There are many bad stories (four).The image of Doyoung has changed./The design of the interchae is very poor and there is a lack of accurate explanation of the subway map.The Oedo Line Station was completely connected to the Asakusa Line Station.I had to take my luggage upstairs and walk for 10 minutes to Asakusa Line.There is no escalator at the entrance.Many tourists arrive at the airport using this connection and suffer from this nightmare.It seems to have been deliberately done with the harassment of N Doe Subway users.Before we transfer properly, I want you to express it in Japanese, English, Chinese, and Korean.For the elderly and those with bad legs, it was hard to know and complained for foreigners.In the normal Japanese people, the hard and tired body came to the head!I bypassed a stop away to go to the elevator on the plane, but I couldn't find it.Finally I carried my luggage down.I went up the stairs and saw the elevator exit!The entrance to the elevator and the outlet are so weird!/The round -trip transportation with Haneda Airport is not provided.However, there is an elevator for carrying the baggage at the A0 exit.It is connected to the route to Narita Airport.If you are going to Haneda Airport, you need to pull your luggage and climb the stairs to the opposite platform.Plan ahead of which entrance to use before you bring your luggage.And from 33 years in Showa, three Tokyo places have been held in the year.The history that remains in my impressions is Ohho, Kashiwato, Tochinokai, Sada's mountains, North Fuji, Koto Sakura, Wajima, and the sea of Mie.In addition, the name of the role of Kurama is derived from the Mikura of the shogunate in this land.In short, it has been only 30 years since the summo was performed in the current two -country national makes.The transfer of the Oedo and Asakusa Line is about 5 to 10 minutes by walking on the ticket gate and the ground.If you go to a crowd fireworks every time, there are road regulations or various regulations if you do not go from the morning.??…/The entrance of the Oedo Line and the Asakusa Line of the Guramade Station are different.I think it would be nice to have an elevator.The transfer of the Oedo and Asakusa Line is not recommended because it walks a significant distance.The succession of Oedo and Asakusa is too bad.I didn't know it at first. "
47,"← I don't know?There cannot be.The guy who designed such a transfer station is quite far from the Doei and Asaku Lines.Let's confirm in advance./It's only in Tokyo Marathon.It's easy to use.I can't help it, but every time I visit, I get tired of the inconvenience of transfer.It is an absolute nightmare.There is a separate entrance in each direction.!/To go to Asakusa, this is empty.It takes/rarely used station/ground transfer is too much.Far away ./ It is easy to know ./ I use it many times.It's hard to find/It's a long way to get a transfer ./ I can't see anything.Station/Yeah/Old subway station/production is bad."
48, transfer is not recommended.Is it better to change your name?It is the closest station of Asakusa Loku. 
49, people who are using water come out without seeing it?/The response of the station is too bad. 
50,"?I don't want to go again.If you don't know the station and listen to the place?I received the same attitude, and when I heard from another station, I was aiming at the top.I will never go again.The toilet was immediately after entering, but a long -time sensor was triggered and I was very embarrassed.It is the closest station of the Tokyo Sky Tree, which is very clean and managed.I heard it for the first time, and when I heard it a few times, I finally answered.However, the transfer method was different and eventually not attached to the destination.Because the attitude is bad and lies, I don't want to use this station anymore.It is a connecting station of the Asakusa Line. "
51," or difficult to understand/the station attendant was terrible \Therefore, if you are a person who is aimed at "
52," in the train, it's very bad to be in the trend, and it's very bad, and there's something that's not going to get off the train while sitting. "
53, smells in front of the station.. 
54, is blurred or rainy. 
55, is not moist and sweat. 
56, This station has only one window in the first place.So it is lined up anytime.Severe. 
57," because you are doing this, the reputation of Tow Chosun (Dobu) does not improve, so you can't win W Seibu.You can also put gender and bitterness soon?Why is it a rural person./It was faithful with shopping or food.. "
58," It is easy to use in that all genres are equipped../ Do not ride the treasure again.They stopped almost 50 km of train in an accident for an hour on weekends.I hope that the Tobu Line will go bankrupt.Anyway, there's nothing on this train line.Please stay in Tokyo, but stay in Inaka./ The train is complicated and difficult. "
59,The Sies' opinion and the results of the results were noticeable.Destructions are being given. 
60,"/There are no elevators or slopes, so strollers and wheelchair users are hard to use."
61," I told the stationary stroller, ""Is this station no elevator?""I was stupid and hurried, and I was afraid of each child at a distance and dropped the stairs.I felt bad because of the station.I don't think it is used again.When Wolyeong has a small child, I think it's a transfer of transfer by yourself.Can't walk a little more and improve the transfer path?Especially JR.Anyway, it won't be brighter?It was to transfer and transfer. "
62," is called one star in cognition, and we'll be a star deduction.It is unkind production for those who have a stroller because there is no, and it is an unkind production.There is also a bus in Rotary.There are many restaurants in the chain store around the station, so it is very convenient.There are three stores around the station (Olympic, Dobu Store, Miraberu) around the station./ First of all, there is no elevator.There is no elevator when you go to the stairs as it is.Because of this, you can retain or forced dangerous movements to escalators.Nowadays, I think that this is a rare case that we do not respond to this, but it is rare.I really hate this role..I feel very uncomfortable.Asaka Station next to the station is faithful to the station of the station.It is connected to the Musashino Sun North Jose Kasumi Station.. "
63," Dobubu -do is a express.There are many guests of the Musashi Line.Poor/Morning commuting time is that there are many transit passengers with North Joseo Kasumi Station, so the number of kicks is not cleared, and it is more than a crowded guest and a burning guest.And the toilet smells.I can't believe that I'm looking at the atmosphere.In the word of mouth in Asakadai, the Northern Asaka Station on the nearby Musashino Line is surprised because of the opening of the 40s.It's natural now, but at the time, I didn't see it in the same way, rather than the same national railroad.Perhaps Kansai Silver Silver has spread quickly.Do you have a home door, and you are thinking about the safety and convenience of the passengers?It was a place where there was nothing other than the field, so if there was no warrior in Urawana Omiya, there would have been nothing to use this station.Finally, I realized recently, but the express is stopped with gender and wakoshi, but I go to Asakadai without stopping at Asaka with City Hall.Isn't the person of Asaka citizens uncomfortable?It is a sign near the station, and it seems to be called carat town.It was a strange sign that ginseng was pleased with ginseng fields and crowded streets.You can transfer to Asaka Station, so you can take Dobuto Chosun to go to Kawago and Ike Bukuro.If you take a Chinese traffic, you can go without a transfer. "
64, also feels uncomfortable because the convenience store on the premises is closed.
65," The road in front of the pure white poop is not possible to walk without an umbrella, and the newly black sky should never be raised. "
66," I am a little worried about traffic congestion of people and cars on the main road.There is no unilateral prosperity.Around 2019, the area around the station immediately after the MNOization is a bit better than when it was a grassy and non -burning field, from gender to Asakama.Depending on the time and place, you can't call you, you can't do the LINE, you can't even open the transit guide. "
67," \I spent a lot of time in a fairly large area, but I have no idea that I could use something that I could understand.It is nothing more than an amateur written. "
68," But the balance of the maintenance of both sides of the station is very bad.I don't know if it's chocolate, and there's a person who's aligned with the person who remains in the line when I come to another train. "
69, The toilet is dirty according to the image of the road railroad (?). 
70, It is convenient.The 3F restaurant is the worst.There is no shop you want to go in!!Uniqlo is too wide 
71,"'s indication of diamond turmoil, such as an accident."
72," Seibu's car is also on board/convenient, but it is clean, but no accident is reduced ??/The subway diamond is severe.Eventually inconvenience."
73, The commuter express must stop!!!! 
74," The moment I came from the ground and went to the basement, I sweated. "
75," has a ridiculous cooling in the waiting room, but it doesn't work.It is convenient. "
76, It is too severe at the level of tears. 
77, is a station that stops the speed of the bankruptcy./If you do not see the destination of the train properly. 
78," It is very terrible for convenient beginners.This sweat is full.There is a wind when entering the train, but it is very hot because it is basic.It is necessary to make efforts to make the household as much as possible.There is no place to take time outside.The bus stop is not in front of the station.If the train stops due to a human accident, there will be buses to Goen, Oji, and Akabane Station if you go to Hwanchil -gil from Exit 1 and 2.I think there's a taxi running.If you want to buy, buy a ticket to Nerima and ride it to Nerima.If you show that you want to buy a regular pass at the Nerima station, you will return the fare of the facility.It is divided by Goja and Hanno.The number of driving is often headed towards Dobu Dodgeon.If you sleep with the farthest forest park or Hanno as the marina, it will be difficult to recover.The toilet is always cleaned. "
79,D-Wi-Fi is so weak.Perhaps there is a time to lean on Concos's ATM. 
80,"Curry Restaurant/Underground first floor is Yuraku's first line, 2 basement floors are bankruptcy, and bankruptcy trains are passed, but Yura Kuku Line is Wakoshi, Kawagoesi, Forest Park, Ogawa Machi, Ike Bukuro, Ikebukuro,You can go to Bashi, Yura Kucho, Toyos, Shinkiba, Shinjuku Sancho, Shibuya, Toyoko Line./ The cooling is not coming in, and it's incredibly hot all year round. "
81," I think it's definitely using the bankruptcy of Shinjuku.From the piano's tone, "
82,", it's dangerous, but I'm wet in the middle."
83,"Toshin Line needs to go out once, so transfer is inconvenient. "
84,'s security is bad. 
85,The passage heading to the worst. 
86,"If you do not go out, you will be lung by the person behind you.This is the first gateway. "
87,"I was very bad because I drove in the reverse direction.I'm sorry that it's not a regret?It is dangerous if I pay it here, so I think it's good to go to the 24H business Mac.Thank you for your long sister.Homeless people can catch it.There are many troubles, but sometimes people in the station are doing care of people who need support."
88, Seibu has almost no garbage tank or recycled Box (can bottle bottle)Outless) Many homeless people 
89, \I don't want to meet.It is so difficult that there is no alternative. 
90,? Security ： × 
91," If you have a big bag, you have only one escalator, so the movement is a bit cumbersome.It's hard. "
92,"9: 00 ~ 17: 00 (Saturday)/Yeonwon's attitude is bad.I act and settle it, so I'm sorry, so I don't say anything.It's still a young man named Namcheon."
93," If you don't ride a route in consideration of whether you want to go to Doko, you will go to the ridiculous place.There is no train coming back, and I stayed in Bijiho and returned to Ikebukuro station."
94, Moto Machi? Navy is a shityide 
95," When it is bothersome to come out of Ike Bukuro, be careful that the south entrance is very far from the track../ The house is deep underground and the distant is difficult/elephant Gaya.It is difficult to resurrect."
96," because there are a lot of people's streets, I don't like a lot of people, so I think it's an ant. "
97," I don't know at all because the station of Oedo Line and Buddhas is a mess.The station of the road.The transfer from the bankruptcy line to the Oedo Line goes up one escalator and goes to the right passage instead of the second time.It's hard to understand.Living here is abnormal, but the rent is, of course, the closest station of Skueni.If there was, I was hit by a uncle.In the mind, I can't help it because I can't go left, but because I am walking right.I thought. "
98," The toilet of Oedo Line is very clean.I think foreigners can live without a mistake.There are Oedo Line and Buddhist Ships.Very busy during commute.ATMs are available from inside and outside the gates of two routes.The station has a service spirit beyond expectations.Women's reversal of the bankruptcy, the final battle, guide, relieved.It is safely guided.There are cases where you can stop for a long time after passing the express to adjust the diamond.Very busy.Everybody can be stressed by the busy walkerholic while going on vacation.There is almost no silver and sweaty./ The bankruptcy line is a place where the gate is deep in the groove, so you have to walk quite a long distance from the north entrance.In order to reach the platform, whether it is Oe or Fukuto Fresh, you have to go deep into the ground.The station is very empty (no restaurant, shops, etc.), and you need to walk for a long time before reaching the desired exit, the right platform, etc.One of Tokyo's worst stations and the position is great (near Kabukicho and Korea Town), but the platform and stairs are far and too narrow to rush in the morning.In a certain time of the day, stand up and wait for a long line./Sin Okubo's Korea Town is often used to go somewhere in shopping.The flow of the elevator exit has become very soft!/Fukuto Fresh Reverse "
99, I heard that I couldn't find a bag at the baggage counter of Narita Airport before departure. 
100," because of the close of Kabuki -cho, there are many dangerous races.There is also a restaurant in the hidden spots around you../ Easy access."
101," (However, the underground walkway from Shinjuku Sancho Me Station to Shinjuku Station is a bit bad)/When it is near the end, the underground passage with JR Shinjuku Station is blocked by the shutter.The type is a pre -investigation. "
102, rice is hard and hard to strike.I could taste it. 
103,"On the contrary, if you deal with the underground passage well, you can go shortcuts.The transit is so bad that the rush of the rush is bad enough to think that it could not be considered in the construction of the bankruptcy.The station itself is liked, but the station is scary. "
104,'s city is small and wandering./The exit guide is strange.N? Cleanliness: ☆ 
105," The sky is not blue and clear, but "
106, is noisy and many people 
107,"'s ""Shibuya Station"" is separated.Transfer takes time.Since there is a guide, it will arrive if you proceed according to the mark, but when you don't know, let's check the gil order.People feel a lot of danger even on weekdays. "

239," I thought the air conditioner of the vehicle was only mold, but I thought it was a summer, but I was sorry. "
240," is an underground station built in the past, so it is a bit narrow, and the toilet on the premises is inconvenient to be at the distant home from Osaka Umeda Room. "
241," It is a very fast convenience in a short time stop.When the diamonds are so bad that the driving intervals in Nishimagome are empty, there is a lot of people with a narrow home.It is a Doyoung subway used in taxes, but it is a dangerous state for the situation.In order to take a taxi, it is necessary to go to the street, so I don't think it is a station that endures practical at this time.Details/elevators are only on Izumi Dake Sinagawa Station.Wheelchair is at the entrance of Mita Station.The groove is only staircase in the pattern.Maintenance with the Yamanote Line New Station!/Because there is only one side of the elevator and the escalator, the worst is for those who have a substitute from Haneda Airport or those who are uncomfortable. "
242," are old.I know that I like the analog of Japanese analog, but for people who are uncomfortable and foreigners from Haneda Airport, the batch of transit or the equipment is the worst./GOOGLE map, but the A1 exit is marked in the southeast, but it is closed because it is under construction.There is no sign during the closing of the exit, so if you find the entrance from the ground and the southeast, you cannot arrive at the station., I walk a little bit, but I survive. "
243," station is quite old and poor.There are many ointments of Akayoshisa Temple, and it is also a deep temple for Akayoshi.When Akaho was born and raised, I thought that when I was three, I thought I would endure once so that I would forget time in the television drama or movie of the loyalty.Doctors were quietly sleeping and felt that they were still in Japan.So far, there are many people who have been mentioned as Kabukina, doll premature ejaculation, television's era, and books, but the present world runs through the world at the moment and is unstable.I think there is something that cannot be erased.I think that's what it is important for the future of Japan.In particular, if you take a train marked with ""Nishima Gome"", you will move in the other direction from Haneda Airport to spend a lot of time. "
244, is a sad situation as one of the users. 
245," is also uploading the planned plans listed above, so please look at it.The station staff only tells you what to do and what you want to do.In spite of learning Japanese for communication, they asked me to take me to the ticket office with a despised expression, but I just pointed it with my hands.you?If you really don't want to go to the company, don't come here. The impression of Japanese people will get worse.Foreign friends on the train will be worried that they will be angry and missed the train, so I sincerely recommend not to take the train here.There are many things that cannot be used. "
246," The translation of the ticket machine is not properly translated, so I need to have an ICEX ticket to buy a second ticket.Otherwise, no one can understand this system, so you can not buy it and always head to a full counter.There are a lot of stores in the station.I allowed me to go, but the funny thing is that the inside of the station is so big that I just sent it without going out of the station. I wanted to get it for an hour .. I wanted to get a delicious lunch box.It's only 1,000 yen, but it's really good. How comfortable is it to buy and sit on the train?In the end, I can't find a store ~ This shopping mall is so big. "
247," Tourism and business trips, unlike Tokyo Station, there are few gifts and seeds, so it is a huge/huge station, and it is very crowded for Russian Wars, but everything is tidy and very easy to move inside.You can ride ./ If foreign tourists, don't lose the Shinkansen ticket after getting off.If you lose it, no one will solve it.I will also talk about it as a joke.The ticket office and the ticket office staff are in charge.The worst ... I only speak Japanese with a bad smell.I'm trying to break the wall.If foreign tourists are not on the Internet, they do not want to help translate.I am very unkind to foreigners.I only see people.If you don't want to work hard, don't just come to the company because you don't want to work hard.The most embarrassing.I am most embarrassed./The taxi platform is not really.The guy who thought about this may be incompetent. "
248," I think that the taxi platform of the Shinkansen stop station, which is only two of the Japanese capital, cannot really have the design of a narrow place like a city in a province.I think JR's design is not really good.There is no user eye at all.It can't be really possible./ This is a large -scale station where the Shinkansen and the 4th line are boarded.Is it a crowded condition that is a bit of a corona influence and is about 70 % in the morning.. "
249,", but other times, especially the night, the bad, the bad man's management, the people's mint, are very low.(It's worse than Shibuya) "

253,", Uncomfortable and ticket gestures are only Sinagawa row (uphill).On the other side there is a scaffold.It's hard to know, it's small, so it's too much to be overly overly overly overly.Persimmon cannot be denied.I am waiting for my return time. "
254," The loss of time to step on the time will be considerable if you think of it as a whole user./Usually only stops ./ There's only one exit, so it's scary and inconvenient "
255,"It resembles the lonely station of Dobu or Keisei (laughs)/Sinagawa, and it is contradictory with Kita Sinaga (because the other Sinagawa station is at the north end of the Sinagawa -gu, and Sinagawa Station is located in Minato -gu)/Keikyu train is named this Kita Sinagawa station in Yado Kita, but many people think that JR is usually smiling as a Sinagawa station.The train is Sinagawa Station.Guests who go to Nagawa Station have a lot of transfer.There is no fence, but it does not complain.Only one line passes through this station (Keikyu).But this is a disgusting and dirty place.In addition, Sinagawa Station is Minatogu and Kitashi Nagawa Station is Sinagawa.For many years, there are narrow residences/stairs and passages. There are crosses on both sides of this station.The queue train stops here.In the sense, there are stairs and elevators across the Home in the south of the Sinagawa Station in the Sinagawa Station.?Guide signboards (laughs)/diamond confusion does not open at all.Kitasi Nagawa Station"
256," If you do it wrong.This is very shaking.Even after passing, there is a sound that is not shaken and a similarity is heard.The Gaekitaba Station Gakguk is currently exit south of Sinbaba Station.That's why the groove is long for waste, and the car stops at its stability.You have to climb the staircase in the ticket gate and walk a little groove.It's good to have a wider ticket gate?There is also a motorcycle parking lot (paid).The southern exit is a bit difficult because there is no escalator or elevator that falls.The entrance is also prepared for the residents./ Winter central location ... "
257," can shoot trains in the direction of Yokohama, but the problem is a problem .... "
258," Anyway, there are many passes, so take care of the subsequent trains.It stops only very uncomfortable.Besides, it was stolen from this station.The damage was tens of thousand yen.The station came to my head because of the bad attitude.The elevator is only the north entrance./The second station in Keikyu Sunnagawa. "
259," Anyway, I am angry/I use it occasionally.But it's dirty ./ Anyway, if you ask ???? "
260, It is a minus that the toilet is not so clean.The atmosphere of the mood/a young man with a bad pattern can endure/OK supermarket.
261, I am inconvenient because there is no express during the day. 
262," due to the influence of typhoons, it has been raining in tremendous momentum since the afternoon, and the quantity of Tachikai rivers in front of the branch's branch has increased intense.Finally, up to 30cm below the embankment.All of the male staff, I wore a kappa to build a toho, preparing for it.The legs that are somewhat downstream have begun to see the water overflowing slightly, but the typhoon has passed and safely out of the egg.It's an interesting street with frostbite ?? "
263, is not good but lonely.There is no vibrant at all. 
264," is a walking book of leisure.Kei Hin Express Station, near the Sinagawa Aquarium.There was also a redevelopment movement, but it doesn't change at all.I am weak in the station where the express stops (enrollment and peace).As a reverse, it is not particularly characteristic.The crowded time zone is overflowing with people and feels difficult.All of the stations that only stop each of the Keikyu station are not easy to use.I can't stand it! "
265," However, it is because there are many stupid walking down with a walking smartphone.It is wide and usually stops, express, express and three types, but the speed does not stop.I think there are so many! "
266," I had a lot of chaos during my commute.I wanted to give it, but I would like to be overvalued because I don't like it."
267, unintentionally I took a shame ~ !! 
268, station.I think it's very difficult to move to the station without an elevator. 
269, seems to be new.worst.It does not change even after a few years.It is the lowest enough to think that I don't want to ride again.It cannot be compared with JR.Can't you say normally?Lick the hospitality?It's really the lowest.
270, infant was hell.There is no. 
271, This extremely long and complex structure is a negative point for users who actually use the station to the home by transferring the station. 
272,"For local residents who have been dating, the passage of airport pleasure is nothing other than betrayal."

278," But I think it's easy to know that it's easy to know at 20 minutes with an airport pleasant.The northern exit ticket gate is removed, and the shape of the long station is very difficult to use.I want you to relieve it.I hate the morning kamata dash and I don't use the plating gaecyu. "
279," smells very cigarettes, "
280," small escalators are written on the long theme, and the time to get up and down is long.It is difficult for the native groove to use and inevitable.Design that does not think about the user's work.Every time you transfer to the airport line of the day, you are frustrated.Because the legs are bad, JR Kamata uses one coin bus./ The speed of the escalator of the home (3rd floor) row in Yokohama is slow.It is also in its own way, so I want you to speed it up slightly.I was a little surprised by a series of surprises, the exit of the Kamata station itself was only in the back of Haneda, so it was quite difficult until I came out of the car that came out.I think it would be a shame, and I got a chance to use this station because it was a hotel near the Tokyu Kamata Station and used a hotel near Kamata Station, but around the station, in front of this station,I want to go again.I go to lifer or shopping, but there is also Cozy Corner.I go to purchase…/The arrival of the train is not known. "
281," It is clean and excellent./There is only one entrance in a huge station.Even if you want to eat quickly, there is no store you can choose.Dead Space is full of boring stations.I think it's easy to remember if you check it on the billboard."
282," I am disappointed.Time is likely to be overflowing at home and feels dangerous.There are escalators and elevators.There are all kinds of shops on the street, so it makes you enjoy it just by looking at it.The front is spacious and the mall is thriving.Therefore, it is dangerous without a home door./I tried to eat near the station, but I was only discovered because it was found only from the bars of the lunch box or the pub in the evening.Sit in a nearby supermarket and take a break.It is severe: the building is quite clean ./ It is a favorite station.Use./ It is impossible and impossible."

287," If you realize it has changed to Kyoto Qtta Kawasaki Station!Men's station, attitude is too bad.I use professional terms that do not answer this question clearly, and at the end of the meticulous end, the expressions and words are rough ... "
288, is too crowded to know the people next to it (^_^;) 
289,"There is a place to be losing, and the congestion is pressed, "
290," The station in the home was very fat and unpleasant.The transfer with JR also passes a lot of signals, so it's very inconvenient.Ah! But foreign countries are quite far away. In the old days, there is a hard destination.But greed, you want a more faithful installation.You can use PASMO.It is connected to Haneda through the Kamata Station.It is connected to the Tokyo Skytree (Osiage Station), so you don't need a transfer by taking a train to Aoto.It's more convenient than where you need a transfer in Tokyo./ Convenient and use it at a few o'clock ./ Home doors, clean and easy to use/????????????????????There are racetracks of Kanagawa and Kawasaki Horseriding Associations, American football stadiums (baseball stadiums), and racing fields.Therefore, several sports and horse riding newspapers are sold in the kiosk of this station (the frame is licensed from 7-eleven de jap? N ltda). "
291, It was a very difficult station. 
292," is less unexpected!If you don't do it anyway, it seems to be delicate of suicide anyway./Jo-a station that should not be used when you don't have time. "
293, (I failed) (I failed) 
294," is a very annoying station when used as a passenger, and the branch line has a time zone where the train does not come at all.I think the evening exposed to a strong West is midsummer.And when you get on and off, you may have been mistaken for a lot of money if you don't stab an IC card on a dedicated terminal at home, and it's possible to get a lot of money (what will happen to the table…)Conversely, the scenery of the light and local sensitivity is very moody, so there are some things that come even more people who are not trains like me.I don't think there's any damage once in a lifetime.JR's passenger response is also carried out by Keikyu Station. "
295,Inside) (Oda Sakae and Hamagawa Wasaki)/Keikyu's crossing has been seen several times in a painful accident that dies in the Internet or television. 
296," may be bad or JR is bad, but I want you to post properly. "
297,"The area around/station is convenient, but I keep thinking that it will be open quickly because it feels bad because it is very dirty and strange in the bathroom.And I hope you will open the first line that is not used.Because I have a lot of elevation, I suffer from getting on and off, so I usually stop.In addition, the number of elevators is 28872 (2016).Is it too excessive to be an airweight passing station?Unfortunately I couldn't go to the station.Next time, this Keikyu is possible./ At the press school that extends from the station, many railway ships such as JR and JR cargo ships are as well as the Keikyu Line.I want to make it.Cold and hot.The station that doesn't feel motivated/went down to the first time.Barley station.Signs of Barley specifications over the giraffe beer.Naturally there is a giraffe vending machine.It is a scenic landscape.It's uncomfortable to commute.!/It's quite dangerous.It was also covered on TV.There is quite a distance from the stationary look to the groove.The station is not wide, and there is an atmosphere of Shimoachi.It is also a station waiting for passing.It is a representative courtesy who knows nothing but thinks about nothing.There are also cases of transfer in Kamata.There are many fast -paced luxury exiles, so it is surprisingly fast until Sinagawa.If you transfer to Yokohama with a pleasant specialty, you will arrive quickly, but if you try to transfer to Yokohama Line in Higashikanagawa, the connection will be bad, so you will see the express pass.It is a place where you can taste realism.Thanks to the barley incident, it is known nationwide.(Separately knowing where you are), there is no way to say that it is a long way,/special, and it is extremely normal.It is not lively, especially if it is not lively, it feels a bit lonely.Crossing the national highway, the Giraffe Beer Factory will notice to claim the presence.The station itself feels a bit lonely and a little lonely ./ Many users are usually stopped.

298,"Since the compensation was not paid, Satsuma Burns did not surrender. "
299, will be difficult. 
300,It is uncomfortable in the car of the car. 
301," because of that, it is a bit uncomfortable because it is necessary to cross the crossing on the first gay highway.There is a narrow and sharp feeling of each stop "
302," It is hard to use Shinko Yasu Station, but Koya Station makes it more irritating.It is fun to see the train.It is also uncomfortable because it can only be entrance from the island of the gay Hin express and the island of the JR track.There is a mall on the inland side, but you have to go through the underground passage.It's not lonely, or security is extremely bad, but you don't want to use it.I've been waiting for the last 15 minutes, and it was a new record…Why don't you go to the south when you make the underground road, and why you don't want to make it.Keikyu has a narrow home, has a lot of handling of guests, and few people use it.Because of this, there are many Brakke companies that can't go without using Keikyu.Congratulations on pasting on the train, but is there anything else?Maybe this.If the underpass is unreasonable, if you make a press bridge, the train will end up and you will end up in one minute.What are you thinking?. "
303," Keikyu?Just listening to the route that you do not want to use in the future and the input will be used.Everyone is thinking about the same thing, but it's amazing why it is not improved./It seems to have a suicide frequently jumping from the groove.Shino Yasu Station is adjacent to the station.

309," Please think better??/In Kanagawa Sinachi Station, 10 cars in November 2019 passed the train of the 10 -year -old Misaki Guchi Station, so when the foothold was closed, the truck that was trying to cross the road entered the scaffold, and the pedestrian pressed the emergency stop button and the footsteps were opened.I thought it was to come out, but the scaffold was closed again, and the first and second derives of the death Keu was very derailed.In this accident, Keikyu had been working for two days, and the train, which had been working on, resumed driving.It was 11 o'clock in the day to resume driving.With this influence, I did recovery work late at night.Derailed vehicles have been abolished.The truck driver went in the direction of the navigation.The most dangerous is the passage train of the delightful Misaki Guchi Station.Be careful of you.When will the station building be? "
310, Mutual ride was also rejected 
311," has a lot of shops such as department stores.I didn't know that the Nari -Express ticket to Narita Airport was a Shinkansen ticket purchase device, and I searched for a long time at the entrance.It is as it is without guidance.Thanks to this, I lost 4470 yen.I don't have a refund and the station attendant can't speak English and I do n’t know.I only said that I was going to ride a Sea Bass at Yokohama Station "

"
316," It must have had a other way to the platform or there was an elevator nearby, and I couldn't find it, and I was in a hurry to ride NEX.One thing that is noteworthy when you ride NEX at the station is that NEX does not come often as in other stations such as Sinagawa and Tokyo, because the station receives the NEX train from various routes, while the Yokohama station receives a single route.I had to wait 1 hour and 26 minutes until I missed Nexa, but I just went to Sinagawa and took one in 20 minutes."

Most of the Chinese people I met were kind, but there were a few Chinese people who were rude and racist.The Flushing Library was doing it with me as if a Chinese guard was a dog.And the library has been open for 10 minutes, and employees can really be a ghetto regardless of race.

340,"The entrance to the southern stairs of the station was closed for two weeks, but I don't know why I couldn't see a repairman day and night.Inside the station, the main gate of the platform that connects the two directions (Manhattan and Queens) is closed within almost half of the time.It is actually important to this specific station because only the train from Flushing has been operated in the nearby 82th Street for several months, and the commuter people may have to go to Flushing and transfer to the Manhattan train.It also makes other tickets much more busy.

342,"This station is not the most crowded and enjoys the scenery on a beautiful day.I got a wonderful city view.It is between the 61st St.-Woodside Station and the 74th St.-RooseveLT station.Still, the neighborhood is good.It is old.You can't use the elevator, but you can go to the 61st Street where you can use the elevator and the general and express stop, and you can easily move to the Long Island train station.There is no garbage, but a renovation work may be required (as of August 2016).Wheelchair access is not possible./ The subway station requires repair, paint, elevator.Line 7 service is good.I will give you four stars from the funny number.It is very dark because there is almost no lighting/around it.I'm glad I don't have to come back here.Buses and shops???????…/Two useless employees sitting in the booth/station status requires improvement.And Roosevelt stop/Once again MTA service is the worst./ also called Fisk Avenue./venomous"

"
345," I like the old taste of this station overall.If you want to experience the 2000s again, this is your station.I also like some views here.Perhaps one of the worst stations in train 7 or full MTA system.The rainwater falls off from the rugged floor, the bumpy staircase, and often the rainwater falls from the ceiling of the waiting room.dangerous.I've seen people sliding down and falling down a few times.I am also uncomfortable to use the stairs, so I walk straight to 46th Street to come to work.Also, it is not safe to peel off the paint on the floor, walls and ceilings.Young people and children inhale paints every day.I hope someone will file a lawsuit in the city ... So far, it is the worst station in the entire MTA./Someone will be injured.Otherwise, commute is very easy.If you have time to walk to Woodside-61 ST, you can take the express. It seems to always be under construction, but this station can be closed at any time.I try not to use it even if I try to avoid using it.They made this announcement when the train was stopped in the area as scheduled and displayed on the screen.They had to wait again because they did not set the Road 7 on the other side (fortunately they actually arrived on time and the time was accurate).Then I arrived at 61st Street and transferred to Manhattan 7 express train across the platform, but the door does not open!So I changed the platform again and finally I was able to board the right train for more than 45 minutes later than usual.Oh, and I know that the MTA is generally poor, so I invest an hour to go to a 30 -minute place.But at this point, the MTA is expensive, but it is very incompetent, so it will be at least 20 minutes late for work.#mtasucks #higherpriceSworseservice #nomorefarehikes #nomorefarehikesThe only potential problem is the staircase, which has been dangerous for a while.This station continues to repair a kind of repair.At 5:55 am now, I couldn't ride the train because of the congestion!It's less than 6 am!Update: Now two trains are full of gills!It's not yet 6 am!/The train runs frequently and you can see Manhattan's wonderful views.Do not throw away trash anywhere.You can use modifications/reconstruction.I like this neighborhood where quiet and everything is on foot./ Manhattan is a small station in front of my eyes.The problem is the entrance./Subway station/cool ./ Huge/breakfast"
346," things I hate.It will be an aging infrastructure and a kind of balcony.The balcony is too narrow and small.We think we can fall easily, so we need to add some bars.You can also repair the infrastructure./ This is a subway station in 33th Street and Queens Bouivard, which is the only station where train 7 stops here.Safe and safe.It is one of the safest subways in Queens.And it was always a working community.There are many movie studios now, but I have to be invited to the studio I want to recommend.If you come to New York, please visit and keep getting information.have a good day.Thank you for keeping reading my review and watching my photos.Concrete design usually helps to reduce the sounds heard in expensive train stations.But there is no wheelchair access./ My station far from home.Except that office workers, high school students from nearby Laguardia Community College, Aviation High School are mixed with high school students. "
347," Disadvantages: The 7 trains are usually delayed./ If you missed getting off the train from the previous station (40-st. Lowery St Station) that returns from Manhattan, you get off the train from this station to La Quinta in QueensThere are many stairs ... There are a few decent restaurants .. And there are a lot of stairs and some cars that drive fast.Can you call me and wake up?/It is a beautiful place.The time is all clean/then, unlike Bronx and Manhattan, there is so much space/the best train, this is the best train.My 7 train.To do this, I always rode this train ./ Think about a unique subway experience.I really miss those days."
348,"It is a train station where clean and trains run every 2-3 minutes and use it as a lot of people.The low floor is for train to Manhattan.Upstairs, 7 trains are used to operate a train to Astoria and Flushing.I suggest photographers to take pictures on seven platforms.This is also the only station where the B-Division stops on the same platform as the A-Division.//It's a symbolic station for photographers, but it's quite noisy.There are a lot of illegal immigrants!everyday.People do not pay the fee, don't jump on the ticket gate, and look at other places while watching the police!The MTA will go bankrupt soon!It achieves the purpose of connecting anywhere in Manhattan and Brooklyn.At night, it didn't happen to me and I have never seen something worse than usual in NYC's subway, so I want to go out and run away.Likewise, this station is old and completely dirty ... and of course typical cases.It can be noisy, why should it be quiet here?Noise is heard from 2 ~ 3 distance.NYC is also normal.Each person must decide whether or not it is passionate about it.Your experience can vary greatly depending on the ability to climb stairs and weather.It is currently under construction and the space is very limited due to construction and there are too many people, so walking on the platform is very dangerous."
349,"There is no action on this.Be wary and be careful!/This station is a herb and walks from other routes, but it's just a station.Only a few wooden benches are.There seems to be no kind of bathroom.This station next to the river in the highlands can be one of the coldest stations all year round.It is safe and rarely smells of pee.I hope n will run more often.The station is reasonably clean and functional./ Dirty Station -Currently under construction.If you don't suddenly exist, millions of people will be very uncomfortable.It is well consistent with the purpose, so there are four stars.It is dirty.It smells.This is dangerous.There is no employee to help.Of course, there is no police around.Many places are dark and heavy.The train is similar.It's late and dirty.There is no information provided.It's very interesting to visit.It's not very clean, but it acts as a subway role.On the low floor, which is a platform for Manhattan, the train upstairs rushes the track, and every time each train passes through the above station, it causes extreme headaches./Queens.N/W is often late, but 7 o'clock is usually frequent.The station is well managed and feels safe and quite clean.The only problem with the MTA is that it does not create a commuter person to transfer to other train routes in this station.It is foolish to wait until you go to Manhattan to transfer with other trains such as F, M, E.If people want to take another train, you have to pay $ 2.75 to get to another station!The MTA must create a large traffic hub for all trains.Overall, it's quite ordinary, and it gets a little cold in winter.E, M, R trains operate.Weekly services are not generally disturbed, but weekend services sometimes change.Check out the signs because some trains do not operate on certain lines.Also, if you get off the train here, it can be very difficult to go to the desired exit.Prepare!/The platform requires more paints like the Jay Street station with the letters on the floor to the elevator.Sometimes people are on a call, so I can't hear what's talking about in Intercom, sometimes there are too many people, so I don't want to get out of the station, or I'm scared when I speak myself mentally.From my door exit.There is a snack.There is no elevator for the disabled after remodeling.This is an open station.Do not confuse Queensboro Plaza and Queens Plaza.Trains, destinations and different functions are different places.N/W is easily transferred to 7th across the platform when heading to Manhattan.If you need to switch again, use the stairs.Sometimes there are times when the train is not operated, so you need to take a shuttle on the street.The bus is not right below ... just follow the crowd.From here, you can take one stop to G and access Brooklyn without leaving Manhattan.It can only be used after 18 minutes after running.It's a pity ./ I always had a bad experience in this station.Astoria rows (N) and (W) do not seem to appear at all every time they transfer in (7) in flushing.This station has a resentment to me.And no matter what carrier you use, it is not good to receive.I waited for N/W to relieve stress and meditated.Don't worry if you don't have much time to do so because it takes three times more time to go to N/W to Queensboro Plaza.By the time the train arrives, the stress will be relieved to some extent.This valuable space can be easily rewarded with a train vehicle that will soon be filled.Where should I do it?I only talk about the top level and the rest is a secret.Good luck!Movement between N/W and 7 is very easy across the platform.Remember that the direction of each floor is the same.The bottom is Manhattan row and the top is Queen's row./ I like Queens Boro Plaza.I hope N and W will run more often.. "
350,"Remember.Move a long way downstairs and move downstairs for trains 4 and 5./Located in the central part of the long island city, you can always transform the platform between Line 7 and N/W train.The service is a mixed bag (2-4 (7) train has a 1-2 (n/w) train). The upper floor is for the Queen's train, and the lower floor is for the Manhattan train.There is an overpass. It does not comply with the ADA and usually has garbage at the top level.It is the only New York City subway station. This station always operates Line 7 and N, and the off -season will operate <7> and W -lines on weekdays.It operates this station with six other stations by the 4th of the month. It is three years after the R188 vehicle was assigned in 7. It is also close to Queens Plaza but no free transfer.If this lacks, it will cause confusion.It can be really cold in winter, but in summer, it tends to provide a beautiful sunny view.The only way that requires some modifications is:Schedule adjustment between the Broadway line (N, W) and the 7th line.Can I reduce the overcrowding of this station if it is connected to a nearby Queens Plaza station with a small number of passengers?Perhaps ..?/Unfortunately, homeless people are sleeping across the seat and have a smell of urine. Where are the people who will help homeless people?It is not enough and the Russian War decides to send a randomly extract to Astoria Blvd.Astoria continues to expand and the MTA continues to play its role.There is no place where the incompetence of the MTA is as well as here./ There are three constants, but there is no need to wait for a long time, and the only difficulty is that it is rainy and the roof is severely damaged, but water leaks, but there is no need to walk for transfer.You can ride Line 7., W and N./are pretty good and clean.You can move to almost everywhere in New York at that station ./ Very peaceful area/public transportation is not to be mentioned.The experience is that I went home by train.Do you need to say anymore?Cleanliness is the same as anywhere else in the city.The elevator for the mother who is dragging a stroller must be installed with the maintenance.And cars should stop between the stops and do not ventilate well !!Kobid still exists. This is one of the most crowded traffic hubs in the city where several bus routes and subway lines stop here.Don't get off the train here.I won't be able to hear the news again.Here, two lines are connected.The cleanliness has a lot of unfortunate things, but this is the standard of NYC public places.The upper level is 3 levels higher than the distance level./ This is a train station that seems to need more work./ New York's 100 -year -old subway is still dirty after cleaning.The slope is tough, but the landscape from the summit is wonderful/good/a good station close to some hotels and restaurants./The toilet is closed at 11 am, but there are many people looking for the bathroom.I will have a good weekend with my family./ The stairs are unstable.It is a place where repair is needed./I liked to ride the subway anywhere!Meet new people!/High subway station.Above all, it is clean/especially on the weekends, N trains are very lacking.It's very cold in winter!/It's amazing place/Super Megapos N Train/Train Station, I think it's at the entrance of Queens.The sound grows here./Where to transfer/I stayed in 2016.This station is dangerous at night.It is annoying for the elderly/it's okay/I like this because it's cold in winter/(w) because I have been serviced again.It's icon!/I always use this train station.I'm pretty busy/it's okay.

RENE came to us.He not only helped us find the perfect car, but also provided amazing deals.At least my family and I are very satisfied with the new car./I do not like women working in tokens.The unpleasant attitude of people who sit there and do diarrhea and receive money.If I ask an example or no question, do not add lips, but forget the teacher, or the teacher's answer.I am not your child.Because you are forgetting your place.Queensboro Plaza is one of them.The advantage is that it provides a great and well -time train service.Manhattan's Venetian decoration is not really in this world.Since MTA is working on the signal upgrade of Line 7 and the two stations of the N/W line are being renovated, especially on the weekend, you should be careful about changing the service.He grew up in Ridge and joined the Marine Corps and retired in 2000.I really miss you just to see.From 2010 to 2016, the Q train operated a different station from this station and Astorian line.The shuttle bus is very slow.Taxi time./ On weekends, most of them are always cracked in the station, even if they are disabled in a wheelchair, the elevator for the disabled is where the elevator is and the staircase feels (or down)!It's annoying!"
351,The escalator from the G to the 7th train rarely works.It is best to use this to transmit G to 7.
352, is a bit confusing because there are different entrances that are quite far away in different directions (not across each other).There must be a map.I saved a long and cold walk!Go to the middle layer and check in which direction you go before scratching the metro card.The direction of the platform is displayed on the entrance sign ./ More police or security is needed .// Bruck Cleans can be done better by using the subway from Queens to Bru Clean. 
353," This is good and most trains arrive on time.There's a terrible bottle phenomenon at a really dirty and commuting time.The trains are not clear immediately at the level of uptown or downtown.Cleaning is desperately needed.The tiles are dirty, the paint is peeled off and broken, the bench is dirty, and the track is covered with garbage (but this is not amazing because most subway tracks do).A new speaker is installed but it doesn't work yet.They installed two or three accurate subway time plates 99.9%.This subway station is convenient in the surrounding area, but it requires a massive renovation work.It occurs less often at night.This station is clean enough and is in a convenient location in this neighborhood.Unusually, the direction of the train, that is, the entrance to the station is the opposite of other places, be careful if you are unfamiliar.Everything accessible.Beautiful docks and prices.The police need to take control of New York City again./The train service here is great, but the station has been done for several years without any prominent progress.There is no transit between the platform, which tends to be an obstacle to tourists who came in the wrong direction in the GCT.Many people use this station every day.If they keep it clean, we will be able to solidify all of us.It's okay.In this station, you can use free Wi-Fi and mobile phone services.Overpasses are needed between the two platforms.There is a wonderful tile work on the wall.I come out of Jackson without plugs that block 50th and water in the front of Times Square.I go to Vernon Blvd and go back to Manhattan from 50th Avenue.There is a plug there.Why is there at one end and there is no end at the end?Is it MTA BS?The water level seems to be similar.The distance to New Town Creek seems to be the same.However, it is a very good area during the day./ Even if it's okay, you have to connect the platform "

364,"The last station of Uptown 6.There is an overpass directly connected to Pelham Bay Park.This station has an elevator, which does not work dirty and always.There is a Dunkin donut across the street and a magazine at the bottom of the train station.This train station was always dirty.The good thing is that you don't wait for a train to the city for a long time.To avoid confusion, you need to change the name of this location.

366,"As of September 2017, it is the most ugly 6th train station in Bronx.All other expensive stations have been renovated, but this station does not seem to be.Did you lack funds?Is it because of the adjacent train?Who knows.Since there is no elevator, the station is on the ground, so some mobility is required.It is estimated to be about 60-70 steps from the first floor to the subway platform.Since construction is underway in the square, some of the stops for connecting buses have reduced the atmospheric space.After paying the fee, I added a photo of the countdown clock that can be seen before climbing the stairs on the platform..Trains come at a reasonable speed except for late time, and usually there are not many people in normal time.There are many places that connect by bus outside the station.The station is not so dirty.The average of NYC.In repair, it is in progress.There are several buses that stop around.There are many commuters during the day.There are many elementary school students because there are high schools nearby.are you okay.It's not worse than I saw/It's a good place to see more shops and restaurants than the train stop.Thank you ./ I like stained glass.really good.White castle nearby.There are many stairs and the entrance to the disabled./There is a nice park next to the subway and local shops.I have lived in this area since 1992.I can eat/I wonder why there is no escalator in this station.Wheelchair access is not possible and not clean.Small and clean .....

369," We can also see the marks marked ""wet paint"" in hard and rusty supports and that the paint is not painted.It is clearly seen.Everyone laughed with a picture on the FB.It's comfortable and good, but I hope there's a lot of competition in the subway trip.Perhaps they will act together./There were many police officers there, but now it is time to turn on the paint work and lights more./ The creepy subway station I have gone to the rats and homeless people are always around.The 138th Street is located in the MOTT HAVEN zone (6) and SLOW Services and <6> Fast Services are operated.It is not a station that 138th Street is in a neighborhood that is not safe.Instead, it's a good idea to use other stations or buses./ It's very dark, so you need to update the elevator and upgrade the lighting!It may not be a little safe at night.At least the express train stops here./Best grade!The food was fresh and hot!/This facility needs repair and it looks abandoned ./Nyc MTA./It's close to buses and trains, but it's impossible to access wheelchairs.It looks dirty and broken ./ Good station may require some cleaning.Go from point A to point B./ Need work/very quiet and good place/messy and furious.Typical New York Subway Station/Good Train Stop.The small one of the bx.6 train ./ I need more hygiene./6Train is the worst stop!

370," One thing that's unfortunate is that there's no bathroom like all NYC subway stations!Since it is a major station, both express and slow trains stop here.The station is completely ADA complaints.The highest layer is the middle two, then there is a Bronx row platform, and the lowest floor has a downtown train.The station is always very crowded, especially in commuting time, where everyone in the station turns like a small village at the same time.To move to the basement, you need a shade elevator.are you okay.It's just an ordinary Harlem subway.A bad train arrived on time.I don't want to sit here and talk about cleanliness.NYC Subway.ㅋㅋㅋ It's all dirty, so it was okay.I took it from A to B quickly.And that's all/this station is unpleasant about 75% of time.Stain, the garbage of the platform, the urine of the elevator.Homeless, drug addicts, and mental illnesses have a big problem.Police and poetry do nothing to solve this problem.It is a major transfer point used by most commuters, so it is busy and congested for most time.I usually die around 10 pm and come back around 5 am.The guests are all afraid .... "
371," The train of this line is delayed on weekends.You can't escape from a distance or subway station.Be careful..The line itself may sometimes have a lot of currency, but in most cases it is very stable.Train 6 is on the top and train 4-5 is at the bottom.There may be crazy people here and there, but it is not new to me, and if you do so, we welcome you to NYC.If people refer to the Second Ave here, they feel uncomfortable.As of 2017, this line is up to 96th Street.The second stage is still in progress, so be calm.This is a LEXINGTON AVE route, not Second Ave.If you need the Second Avenue service, please use M15-SBS.Walking from Lexington to Second is not a big deal.They removed their seats and made them age or sick..Interesting characters do not recommend taking cash out before anyone, and no one believes./It is a very good access area.It is connected to three subway, five bus lines, and metronorth, but the station is dirty and the same is true of the nearby restaurant.Metro North connection route is available with 4/5/6-MTA/train.Is the burning smell terrible ??/Basically, it is a typical subway station with a feeling of Harlem.Drugs own the station.It is good not.The platform may be very full when the train is delayed or the entire customs clearance of the train is required.At 5:40, people stand out from the front of the train to the back.Come on ... this is the daily ""service"".PlatformIt is not completely safe compared to the number of strollers and children.There are too many homeless people and people are rude to the WOST train station in Manhattan.In Manhattan, the 125 Street and Bowling Green are executed, so they skip the two stations of Full Street and Wall Street.In the Brooklyn Express, I go between Borough Hall and Franklin Avenue, but I skip five stations except Church Avenue between the weekly express and Franklin Avenue and Flatbush Avenue!If you take 2, 3 or 4, 5, 6, you'll be on the same plane. But be careful because it's a zombie land.The train has always been full .. I have been doing this for more than two years, and I can't believe that nothing has changed.

"
372,"Here, drugs are openly traded, and there are no guards at the subway station, and addicts can open an emergency exit and take the train for free.I never want to drive again in this station./Many drug addicts sell the latest boost items.They need to be careful and self -awareness when they go through the streets as legally, and this must be the most sketch of the subway station I've ever been.Rotate your head here and do not come after dark.Women should be especially careful.There are many homeless and drug addicts outside.Very crowded ./ Be careful when using this station at night.Be careful and safe.It's a bit scary at night ./ The platform is as clean as the New York subway station (not completely dirty), but there are four stars because the indicator of Wi-Fi and the next train will come.This station is crowded while taking the train to Bronx.Except for the day of the week unless you go to work in general?It's amazing because the train station is not crowded at any given time.The service can be slightly improved to alleviate the congestion that occurs in the station to 125th Street.While going in the other direction, there are few people because there are few people after 125th Street to the city.I have been to see how long the social distance sticker is, which can be understood, but now there are no one who actually follows it.The station is relatively clean and natural.I saw employees who kept their places every day or as much as possible, and there was no other complaint about the station as far as I knew.We are planning a project plan for.I love New York.

379," Thank you.Unlike the spacious, ardeco style and relatively clean Metro North level, the MTA zone is crowded, crowded, and even in the elevator, it smells from an old coat -covered pile covered with 15 -year -old vinegar and corpse fur.Strangely, it is specific for the smell).The platform is always thin and crowded, as the characteristics of the main terminal, but are covered with mud that can not be described in almost everywhere.However, the platform was very clean, the service was consistent, and it was easy to access the main Grand Central Terminal.In the middle class, there is an intermittent act, so it is not a waste of time./Most of the reviews here are about Grand Central.But this is the Grand Central subway station location.

380," The cost of traveling is $ 2.75.It is quite easy to connect between the path, which is especially important on the weekend when the path to the World Trade Center is closed.It takes a long time because I go to Journal Square and transfer to other trains. ""Even though there are schedules and boards that are updated with ""real -time information"", they can be reliable as much as 8 times of magic.It must be managed/There is no way to pay with a decent path/Apple Pay compared to other stations in New York, and you need to buy a ticket card!It is one of the main stations that can ride the PATH train.Very busy but clearly displayed guidelines/worst train stations in New York.Credit cards for touch and high in the ticket gate, Apple Pay cannot be used, and vending vending vending cards can be purchased in the 1980s, and cash cannot be used.I tried to buy a ticket with a credit card, but it was a nightmare.It took 12 hours.Try to finally make a ticket issuing a ticket.It was really the worst experience./ New York is a very nice and clean subway station in New York.I have tried more than seven times on each computer, but I can't handle it.Others require accurate change.I gave up almost without any help, and I tried it last time just before using the Uber, and I could buy two travel cards without recharging.The same is true for WTC machines.It's the worst machine needed to board the train, but it doesn't work.This is a great location if you want to board the PATH train from Manhattan to New Jersey.Journal Square, in particular, is not only Jersey City but also the main location/transportation hub of New Jersey and New York City.I like how to board a special path metrocard.The fare is now $ 2.75 in the United States.Disagreement.It's a bit confusing to go around when you pass it for the first time, but after passing through the PATH stop, you will be able to go to a decent place where you can go elsewhere in the city.Most of the North Jersey can be easily accessible.Hoboken train seems to be a bit less crowded, but it's just the day I rode.The service is fine. There are good days and bad days. It is better than sitting on traffic and paying for parking fees and tolls. ""This overlap is a fascinating multi -layered subway station.Add the path line to see the tremendous flow of people from all autonomous districts and people from Hoboken and Journal Square.Unfortunately, one of the most crowded exits heading to the streets is currently under construction, so the entrance/exit is crowded and sometimes conflict with passengers who move in the opposite direction.So walk easily and carefully when you are here.In the summer when the entire basement turns into a furnace, you can arrive close to the desired departure time (the timetable is posted on the PATH homepage), so you don't have to be underground for too long, and you don't have to suffer in the heat..If you don't have a ticket, it may take time to buy, so assign an extra time.This station is directly connected to Manhattan Mall/JC Penny, so it is convenient for those who want to shopping.//It is excellent in access to Empire State Building to Empire State Building.Route 6 is very crowded, so avoid commute.Nevertheless, the train operates quite often.Use for more than 1 year.It is impossible to buy a ticket every time, and every time you miss the train./Train station to NJ PATH.That was my first impression of New York.

The staff were looking at the office window without doing anything.I don't know who's there, but he was very cold just by trying to attract someone's attention.Well, I was late, I wanted to go to the hotel, I didn't plan to use the pass anymore that night, and I couldn't use it tomorrow (although it could be used that night).There are so many people waiting and the crew didn't do anything.But that should never happen.As long as I know, the machine should not use the JR Pass.Therefore, this station has not only employees (inefficient) but also major technical problems. "
593,"I passed through the paid JR gate, and after walking and walking, I had to go out of the gate to go to the line instead of JR.Because of the same station, I thought that the card would be settled because of an error in the card.I literally charged only the charges!For walking!And I followed the sign and I don't know what happened, but if you look at my Google map location, you seem to have sent me to a huge circle ??This station is a complete fraud./jr and Tokyu's intersection.It's a little far away, a passage of contact, but walks.Keep walking through the transfer, transfer, and southern route platform to climb the staircase escalator and arrive."

601," while waiting for the train, this bad smell hell. "
602,"I only knew it, but I can't understand why JR has granted it.The grooves of Sun -Shonan Shinjuku Line are quite separated from other lines, which takes time to transfer.In addition, the number of grooves is not too small for the number of users, and on weekday morning, the home regulation of the home is everyday.I can't keep it. "
603," I feel that it's a regret that is not maintained for transportation networks for tower mansions and redevelopment.Transit movements are also very crowded, so it's a good idea to take a leisure and transfer.Air conditioning is more effective than home waiting room (laughs).The Tokyu Toyoko Line is not good to connect to the ticket gate, so it can be around for waste.I wonder if the connection between JR and Silver is not kind at other stations./Tokyu line is clean anyway.Commercial facility access is also outstanding.However, the home is narrow, so the escalator cannot receive one up and down.In addition, the access to the south exit of JR is very bad.This may not be possible, but…/If you cross the river, there are already a lot of strange workers, or because you have an excessive mortgage or stress with work, and the rush time zone is a bloody atmosphere.Unmanned, I am the center of the world.

606," It is easy to know the signboards of the home.Traffic is very dangerous.It is also seen in this place that the residents of Musashi Course and the poor quality of the Nanbu and Toyoko ships are bad.See more phenomena, think of it with your head, and put on paper. "
607," in the peak time zone, the passage is completely blocked and the passage is completely blocked. "
608, There are a lot of walking cigarettes and illegal dumps around the station.

The position of the train may not be displayed on the platform of the train, depending on the seat location of the train.I like Tokyo Line.It takes 10 minutes to commute to the Toku Line on the JR line.only…The home and the native line, such as the Yokosuka Line, are too far.It may be fast to use each thorns and Shinkawasaki in the neighborhood.The fare will increase as you come out once, and the fare will increase.In addition, it is recommended to check for each line of transit, as it requires 8 minutes and 5 minutes in a hurry, because the nymph line and the Yokosuka line (or Sotetsu direct line) and the standard for 5 minutes are in a hurry.Since April 2022, home doors have been installed in Nanfan Line Home.JR's Ekinaka has only toilets other than the event space, but on the Yokosuka Line and the Tokyu Line, there is no difference from Ekina Ka, and the store is faithful.In addition, there will be a passage with the Toyoko Line at the exit of the Yokosuka Line (2023).?/Why is it so inconvenient here ...

613," This is Toyoko Line.PET bottles and cans are abandoned.In addition, there is a caution that don't throw away garbage.Since there is no garbage bin,I think it's strange.It will continue to be abandoned in the future.Nothing was purchased from the station, not home garbage.I think it's irresponsible.I would like to tell you not to sell it in the station unless you make a trash can.20230701/Yamada Kyoko, that's a developmental disorder. "
614,". Besides, the price is high! "
615," It was good to not move.I really regret .../When I try to use an escalator when heading from Tokyu to Nanhu Line, it sometimes smells like a strong raw garbage.The collection site is nearby, but I hope you will take some measures.So far, it was the same form in the upper and lower line, so the morning and evening was overflowing with people.Since it has become a form of the upper and lower line, I think that the congestion of the groove has been resolved.Therefore, it is difficult to arrive from the street on the route of the purpose. "
616,".It is also known that the transit between some lines is very time -consuming from the situation that adds the line as described above.The tower mansion is built in front of the station, always homeless and not much good.There was only an image called the bad station of the security of the security, but the tower mansion was also a little clean.There are a lot of playgrounds, bonnell runs, restaurants, and medical institutions for a large child, but it is very convenient, but it is very convenient, but because of the "

618, I don't know this uncomfortable station./ Weekday morning is very congested.
619, The city is not bad.? 
620," is a waste.When you get off at the station, you can see only Tawa and rich in green.It's a good place to be convenient/livable because access is good, but because of this role, Yokosuka Line is now a regular of the congestion rate!(4th, 191% 2016) It takes more time to take more time, where all the users in the west are all closed!Besides, the paving of NEX or Shinjuku Line is so preferential to pass!Wherever you go, it's fast. "
621, It was very unpleasant. 
622, I don't want to use it again.The ticket gate is too crowded.A structure that ignores human flow.It did not catch up with the increasing user.The convenience of transportation is a good station.You shouldn't be deceived by a real estate store.I can't help it because there is no land. 
623,I don't want to ride. 
624,"First of all, draft beer is acidic and smells.Is the barrel okay?""Please put three kinds of sashimi,"" and arrive on a separate plate.Yariika, Mackerel, Shimesaba.Yariika and the horse mackerel are too thin and cannot be eaten.Sime Mackerel has little taste of vinegar.If you ask for the recommendation of grilled, Siraco comes out, and this is smelly again.This smell is the first time.And there are hairs all over the place (laughs) "
625, This store should not eat other than sushi!Alcohol is a highball or Japanese alcohol! 
626,Wold (^^) Is there a lot of inconvenience?/The house of the station is too hot. 
627," and it's inconvenient to stay on the slope.Even if it is, it is better to ride the Toyoko line.It is better not to hear what the person in charge says.Any weight is basic.It is becoming such a training./ It has been unfairly condemned. "
628,", a portable battery has been broken. "
629,It's crowded. 
630,", Suddenly the escalatorI stopped so much. "
631," I think it's usually banned when the escalator is stopped, but it was low.There is nothing such guide, and suddenly it stopped.Even after stopping, the two mechanics were looking far away and I didn't realize that I had been.It is basic.I want you to be careful because it's dangerous."
632,", that is, the new residents who came to Hiyoshi and the semi -industrial area of the renewed clean residential area, but the city is a city that is mixed with a bad gala.It will be "
633," The distance of the cremated image is quite amazing.After all, it's far from coming out.(Toyoko ship itself, Yokohama and Shibuya, there is nothing other than the number of failures in Shibuya.) Hiyoshi's own land was a slope.It's because it's because it's not planned properly.Since the station is used continuously, there is no space in the reversal, such as commuting in the morning, so there is no sidewalk, and the pedestrians, buses, taxis, and regular cars are distracted, and you can see the same wild scenes of the time slipped before the old days..Without a taxi rotary, there is a surprisingly long procession of a taxi waiting day on the day and late nights and late nights.The stairs going down to the groove are quite close to Tsunashima (especially the Meguro line is not enough to reach the train), and the groove is crowded to the center every morning.I think there's no idea that the fuck of the route on the Scascs Cine downhome is somewhat.I would like to say that it is not the case to sell a high groceries by making a department store in front of the station.I lived here and not originally lived in a city in Tokyo, but I was honestly surprised by the overwhelming rural feeling.It is a level that people who live in Hiyoshi will be deceived by documentary or brainwashing in many ways.This is uncomfortable, prices are high or understanding.Is it because it is the birthplace of the Dokyu train because it's a semi -underground station?There are many restaurants and popular shops around the station.Since Megu is connected to the North and South Lines, access is good to the northern Saitama, such as Naguro Naguro Naguro Naguro Nagatacho or Gorakuen, Prince and Urawa, and Takashimada.(There's also a green line, but I don't think it's a good thing about access, because all the warriors in the north of the center are not enough in Yokohama.) However, because the shops in the station are closed around 9 o'clock.I'm sorry.He responded to a person with a tamet mouth. "
634," The transfer is smarter, but Toyoko's side is so climbing and getting off again, but it is far away.Since the mouth is a one -way traffic, a preliminary investigation is required when you come by car.In addition to the trouble of traveling to the window several times without conveying the necessary matters at once, the reverse of the reverse was also unhappy.Even if I questioned the purchase of a regular pass, I received an early answer.I knew that nothing was solved even if I asked in this station.Reverse, pretend not to see!There can be no "
635," On the bus route, there are also a number of buses to JR Yokohama Station and the exit buses west of Tsurumi Station.Thrumi Station is a good way to use the bus.If it's a train, it is necessary to transfer to the Kei Hin Tohoku Line at Higashikanagawa Station. "", The worst station. "
636," I really want to move.Therefore, you must transfer to other trains (Tokyu Toyoko Line)./JR, the transit of the document is also very convenient?It was somewhat comfortable because I was able to do it, but because I created a useless four -story building history, the round trip of the elevator is slow and the flow of people is still dull.After the remarks of the transfer only after the disappearance of the transfer, it is a crowded line from the morning to the evening.The day is hell. On a rainy day, the line of guests waiting for a taxi bus from the east exit to the west is no longer a specialty.In particular, even though there are many users in the city, we still use small entrances to the era of construction and continue to use it.It seems to be pleasant, but it will be in this state for the time being unless it is barely denied the sense of being made on a narrow land.There are very few places where you can eat snacks such as major fast foods, such as terminal station classes, and there are no charms other than the station.Is very dangerous.The first person may be a bit embarrassed by the transfer of JR and Tokyu./ It has become easy to use in reverse, but Shinyokohama lines have long been a long -standing transfer with Tokyu Shibuya ??????I think it will continue for a while./"
637," I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to ride if the Yokohama line is boring after 23:00.In transfer, even in the transfer, even if you live nearby, it is less convenient because it becomes strong every day.It is convenient to go to the wheelchair side or Shinyo Kohama because it is preferred as an elevator.However, the walking of the transfer is reformed, and the stairs are badly deployed.Local lawmakers claim that they have improved, but they are not user.JR Yokohama Line was opened in 2018 and became clean.Tokyu Toyoko Sun is dirty overall.In addition to the Tokyu Store, there is a kiosk, but the commercial facilities are weak, including the surrounding area.The development and urban plan for railway companies and local governments are weak.There is nothing, despite a vast person transfers every day.There is an advantage of using the Toyoko and Yokohama Lines nearby.JR Yokohama Line and Tokyu Toyoko Line cross the transportation and easy use.There is a Tokyu Store before the opening, and it is open from 7 am to 1 o'clock in the late night.In addition, if you walk for about 5 minutes, there are also Gohoku Library and Summit Store.I don't want to move. "
638," If you don't go to the ticket gate, it's unkind and unkind. "
639," If you do that, I think that the station was able to improve the level of Omiya station.In particular, the JR is narrow and packed soon.The box alone, the passage is unnecessarily long and the convenience is a regret./jr Kikuna has been renewed and improved, but the convenience of history is not so good.In particular, there is no dedicated elevator from the first floor and it is very difficult to understand because it is publicly used to be publicly used for the Tokyu Store.Because "
640, is not convenient. 
641," is incredible, but the train starts earlier than the scheduled departure time (time written on the timetable timeIt may be different from.When I asked the staff, I admit it is a measure to prevent delay in other stations (!) Then I wonder what the timetable is.Why does the train do not need to arrive on time in this station?It is ridiculous to do this so that you can arrive on time to another station.Instead of telling JR's inaccurate departure time, we look forward to planning the time you need ...It was used around 11 o'clock week.It's crowded./The way back from Yokohama Arena always walks up to here.I was surprised that JR-TY's connection passage changed because it didn't visit for a long time.It's annoying because there's a lot of climbing.It will stop in the train and stop at the rapids of the Yokohama line..Tokyu Toyoko LineThe express 5050 is 8 cars and 4000 cars are 10, but the Tokyu Toyoko Line is not 10./ The JR and Toku Line are unknown while under construction.For the elderly or the body of the body, the subdivision, and the nanny cars, unkind station.It seems to be clean with the renewal in 2019. The Import Bus at the east exit of the Kikuna Station is a one -way traffic to the west exit of Tsumi Station through the old Tsunashima Gado.However, it is dangerous for the route bus to cross the Toyoko Line crossing, so it is not open and cannot be operated on time.This is because there is no plaza in front of Kikuna and cannot be done last time.In addition, the morning and evening in front of Kikuna Station is severe, and the crowds of Mt. Okura or Tsunashima can not be reversed.After the Tokyu Line and the Minato Miri Line were connected, the transfer became very convenient.It is hard to transfer at Yokohama Station./ There is no rotary place in front of the station.The bus is one of the stations that you do not want to use.It's hard to say that it was convenient after the modification?Especially in front of the station, it is really narrow and united, and inconvenient in the lane access./ It is a transfer station, so it is comfortable, but it is comfortable.You can add egg kawama toppings as a royal card, so it is beneficial.At a few o'clock, it is a crowded image./JR can be transferred.

"
728," The next home is the worst.There is no home door, and the exterior walls are removed from the time they were used.There was also a voice that I didn't want to see the groove, which I didn't want to see.It's full.The escalator is only a budget cash, and the entrance is especially congested on a rainy day, and it is not improved.The station in the area where there is also a house or office is difficult for this, and it is not yet fixed.Isn't it the same now after 50 years of 25 years?I am really sympathetic to those in the nearest station./ Tokyo Metro Toy Zay is the station located between Kadomaema Nakamachi and Toyo -cho.It is famous for its inpathy when commuting in the morning.It is also connected from both ends of the home, but it takes a few minutes to come out because the groove is deep.It is a 10 -minute walk from Kiba Park and Monzenaka Machi next to Monzenaka Machi.In addition, there are many famous restaurants in a restaurant in Monzenakacho ~ Toyo -cho in the neighborhood.Home security guard.It was a bit strange.Toca Iseon Nishi Nishi Hu was standing behind Nabashi's home, but the tone of the voice of the voice of the voice is not clearly speaking, but it is strange from others.You must notice Mr. Reverse or colleague's security guards.Let's look forward to a few years later.It is an island home, but there is an entrance at both ends, so there is no passage to the opposite line rather than the entrance.I want to go to Nakano, but when I go to Nabashi, I can't go to the opposite line without walking to the end.No elevator to go on the ground.The escalator is almost the stairs.I like muscle training or optimal for de M./I live in the route of Ceram.Maybe, it doesn't seem like I've got off once.I think it was just passed because there was nothing to be a destination.I accidentally worked for a company in Giba Park.Basically, it is the same distance after leaving the station, so we use Toyocho Station.It was natural to pass through the Giva Station even after passing the street by car, so I walked to check the location near the station when I returned home.It's definitely close to Kiba Park, but there's no sign too much, and inadvertently?To say.It's a very humble station.However, the groove of the upper and lower line is separated, the groove is narrow, no automatic sales, and it cannot go to the opposite groove unless it turns from both sides of the entrance.It seems to be doing a large number of construction, but I hope it will be completed quickly and improved.In addition, it is quite underground, and some escalators are climbed up and down and connected to the ground ./2019/10/07 I use it every day.Among the improvement work (expansion of home expansion, elevator, expansion of escalators), until June 2017, it is mainly reducing the home congestion of the time zone of commuting and commuting, and 3 floors below the groove on the 4th basement floor.The passenger is induced to the 2nd basement floor to reduce the congestion of home and station.Naga Yodori Giba 5 Chome Intersection in the basis of basic construction to be accompanied by underground expansion on the ground towards Toyocho.

779," I do not want to go twice in Nashu Nabashi Station, where these bads are gathered.Because of this, the transfer is complicated. "
780,"jr keio line.In front of the station, Cabaret and Pubs are very high, and the security is very high and the security is bad.n ※ ""Brother…Is there 300 yen?Yesterday, I had to drink too much, and I had to head to my friend in Osaka. ”I raised it with a feeling of about 300 yen, but later, I realized that it was absolutely a lie.Since the amount of the amount is also coming and going, there is a crowd of load sometimes.Starbana Kuniya Bread ??, Buckwheat Shop, New Disney, etc.??? "
781," ※ January 4, 2021, the staff of this station, and the staff called Donghae -rim does not give passengers in the morning rush time.I was talking with another staff.If you point out that you should be careful about your smartphone without talking, you say you are contacted.If you talk about the walking smartphone, you will be able to broadcast properly.I don't listen to it because I don't listen to it, so I think that the issues that are happening in front of my eyes should be careful because they are all walking cheerfully and doing smartphones.I don't think about the safety of passengers at all.It's late after an accident and injury, and I'm late for the company.Standing does not need a reverse.Thank you for notifying this fact.I said.I don't understand my position or work at all.Mr., "
782," It is the worst station and attitude.It is a station where stress is gathered just by using.It is a wind or rain and a fog.There is a lot of things that do not deal with the big ones.I thought that when I couldn't move to the talks with the trout troubles.I don't want to use it twice.From there, the worst. "
783, is a bad manner. 
784,"There is no choice but to lament.The same train is hard?Chiba Bank's ATM is also used frequently, it is helpful when the money is insufficient.I think the review is low and natural.In addition, because Gala is a bad handwriting, the security is also bad.At that time, it was still 20th century, so it was quite a station.It was an image that was not a strangely flourished street or a meaning of Chiba Prefecture.As a terminal station on all routes, it will be quite a great number of passengers, but it is bad to write and the first person will be difficult to transfer.What, if you visit in decades, surprise ??Somehow, there was a stationary building, so it was a wonderful atmosphere, and the southern exit, which had nothing to do, was lively and lively.However, the north entrance still has not changed sadly, as it feels like Showa.It is a surprise.Again, we recommend a full modification, including the North and South Rotary structure.I want to seriously want the city to be 100 times the value of the city.The infamous area around Hunabashi Station is now a bunch, but if it is Nashihu Navashi, it would be okay to change it in earnest for the future of Chiba Hyunmin.Why would you give me a wound?/Always crowded.In particular, the commuter rush's time is very scary to people and people.The response to the delay due to a personal accident or inconvenience is unexpected.The shop is faithful, so if you buy a souvenir, you can't recommend it every day.It may be inevitable because there are a variety of lines, but .../I think it's invincible if the speed of the small line stops as a means of transportation. "
785," The groove of the station/Musashino is not stopped.Kyu -gyu as a person who gets off the car and a person who wants to ride.Put too many people in the house.You must limit your entry under the stairs.The risk of an accident is a risk of accidents ./ It's impossible, impossible and good station. "
786," I can't help it because it's a small station, but I am a little sorry because the station is not faithful. "
787," because the surrounding area is a bit lonely impression, I think it would be better to be more lively.It is a leading Mega Terminal in Chiba Prefecture, where redevelopment is urgent.Residents and users are giving up while feeling stress.It is good to not be a Achilles tendon that waters the population that continues to increase, but even though there are plurality of lines, there are too few guidance such as getting off.I don't want to use it.However, I later learned that I could listen from a friend and made it here, so it was two days later, so I didn't think of it from my friend's comments.However, it is very inconvenient because it is not a fast stop station.Regardless of the men and women of people, I want you somehow to come down without the specifications.He is a person who comes down from the Musashino line.It is better to meet the ticket gate.Once you come out, it's also difficult in the bathroom.Wouldn't it be too late to notify around 1403?I don't want to see the efficiency of Japan./ From the north exit of the station, Christmas illumination is very beautiful!..
