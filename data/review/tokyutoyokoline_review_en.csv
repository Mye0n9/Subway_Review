The role of Yokosuka Sun was good for shooting.After that, I checked the bag not to bother people, but as I had confirmed in advance, I couldn't know that I could be complained because nothing was inserted.No matter how much I noticed, I think it's not good to run away from the explanation responsibility because I'm concerned with people without any evidence.The place of the QR code was close to the Shonan Shinjuku Line, but I rode the Nanfan Line from Kawasaki.When I went to Totsuka from the west, I used it as a transfer of Shinjuku Line.The movement from the Nanbu Home to the Shinjuku Line Home is 5 minutes (^_^)There is also a relationship, and if you need to regulate admission, such as eye day, it will be overflowing with a person until the opening of the Toku Line.It is the route that leads to the ticket gate. \ N \ n has many ticket gates that lead to outside, there are many shopping malls such as commercial facilities or Gran Tree, and three bus platform taxi platforms, so the first person is the first personIt would be good to share the shops that are covered by the encounter, and \ n \ n, especially the opening of the Yokosuka Line and the Neck Line and Toyoko Line, so be careful when you meet. \ N \ n TokyuIn addition to the line, the JR is clean and the air conditioner is comfortable.Hundreds of meters from high -rise mansions, there was a great Boro apartment that could not be Sendai, and it was attacked by a strange sense.That period is a warrior course.The station building Tokyu Square is equipped with small but faithful shops such as daily goods, clothes, and restaurants in groceries.Since it is a bus society, you can use the bus to enjoy some trips.The commuter rush in the morning and evening becomes a crowd of people who can't do anything, but the holiday can be a bit relaxed.On the Tokyu Line, it was quite convenient by the board of trilogy, such as the forest park, Hanno, Hatogaya, and Nishita Kashima Hirahe.It was a village with nothing. \ N Now the home is a passenger, and the home is very hard to return the home in the morning and evening.: \ n Tokyu platform ↔ JR Out of the Passenger ↔ JR Stick ↔ Nanbu Line Pass ↔ Yokosuka Line (Shonan Shinjuku Line) Platform \ N. \ n./JR Magger has eaten my JR rail pass for 7-8 minutes alone with the Nabu and Yokosuka Line.It was the last day of use, but it was around 8 o'clock, so I could still use it for several more hours.I don't know if the machine is taking it after the expiration date, but I haven't taken it yet.I just told you to wait here.Many people were already waiting for other problems. The staff were looking at the office window without doing anything.I don't know who's there, but he was very cold just by trying to attract someone's attention.Well, I was late, I wanted to go to the hotel, I didn't plan to use the pass anymore that night, and I couldn't use it tomorrow (although it could be used that night).There are so many people waiting and the crew didn't do anything.But that should never happen.As long as I know, the machine should not use the JR Pass.Therefore, this station has not only employees (inefficient) but also major technical problems. \ N \ n And as others pointed out more, it is essentially false to say that the station is not the same station or transfer station.Advertising.You have to walk for at least 10 minutes between the station.At that point, if you are on the other side of the desired line, it's a good idea to just take another train.It is also a problem if you came here for business purposes and choosing a commuting hotel. \ N \ nI passed through the paid JR gate, and after walking and walking, I had to go out of the gate to go to the line instead of JR.Because of the same station, I thought that the card would be settled because of an error in the card.I literally charged only the charges!For walking!And I followed the sign and I don't know what happened, but if you look at my Google map location, you seem to have sent me to a huge circle ??This station is a complete fraud./jr and Tokyu's intersection.It's a little far away, a passage of contact, but walks.Keep walking through the transfer, transfer, and southern route platform to climb the staircase escalator and arrive.\ N If you are a season, I think that the distance is a distance of one reverse.It is not possible to get off, and because it is on the way to the Yokosuka line platform, there is a strange place that is dangerous because the passenger (pedestrian) who always escapes to a certain number of times.Many, unnecessarily dangerous conditions were continuing. \ N \ n continued to continue, the expansion work of the Neckline platform in that problem was being performed, but it was completed.Thanks to that, it's a bit, but the traffic width.However, since the space on the back of the stripped steel pillar is just downward, it is necessary to walk by blurring the back of the pillar in a row while avoiding the pillar.No. \ N \ n is a Musashi KOSGI, I think that the fundamental reform and modification of the line is needed.There is also a caffper problem on the southern line, but it may occur that can cause people to go home at the moment.The layout is wise :/jr and a Tokyu line are on board.It is always the top of the village I want to live.Yokohama, Shibuya, and Meguro are difficult to replace.In typhoon 19, it was swept away by unexpected disasters.It was submerged with water flooding.It seemed to be predicted on the hazard map for the first time./I went twice this year, but both of them were definitely lost in the station. \ NThere is a place where the structure is complicated anyway, and the transfer of the legs of the club is complicated. \ N It is a place where you walk in a station, and there is a place where you should not read it with Musashi Course Station.\ n If you don't know, it's better to ask the people around you or the station.The tremendous congestion of the morning and evening \ n2.

The merit of the transfer at Tokyo Station is the Marunouchi Line and the Yamanote Line and Keihin Tohoku Line.On the contrary, if you try to use the station as much as possible, it's the farthest.If you want to delay a little bit of Rush Hour, you will be overflowing.Considering the safety surface, it was good to broaden it or divide the layer by downward line.Be careful as strollers and wheelchairs are really dangerous.And it takes about 7 to 10 minutes to transfer to southern lines and Toku..Anyone who says that there is no such distance for a favorite person who says that the station is crowded or not entering a nursery, it is good to live in the suburbs that take more than an hour from the city center for convenience and exchange.The transfer of Shonan Shinjuku Line? Nanfan Line) takes 10 minutes no matter how slowly quotes, so if you do not have enough time, you will be wings that will be transferred if you can't afford it.In addition, the liaison passage is a little narrow, and after the difference in transportation between the nanfire and the Yokosuka line. \ NI don't have the idea of Yoshi.The groove of the Yokosuka Line is far from the nanfire groove, and it takes about 10 minutes to move, so it can be called a different station.It is necessary to come out of the ticket gate, but it seems that many people walk out.There are elevators and escalators, but if you are uncomfortable in your body, you may be a bit painful.Each station is becoming a barrier -freeized, but I want you to think of users who transfer..Consider the weather, luggage, and walking speed.The shop is also faithful, and it is a placement that is easy to hear during commuting and commuting.There is a toks next to the garbage on the premises.There is no store on Yokosuka line.Walk anyway.In addition to that, the Sotetsu Line is careful.If you can ride here, the number of trains is less inconvenient, so you will go to the famous Haja and Yokohama National University.About 17 minutes.More than 30 minutes round trip. \ NIs it inevitable?\ n was commissioned by the ticket gate near Nishiguchi.(When you are wandering any ticket, there are most of the green window.) \ N \ n ??Doan and details ?? \ n?Spoiler Caution \ n \ n?

is fast to walk from the south exit and the east exit.And I'm happy to be able to do a shop near the opening of the Yokosuka Line, but around the station, Grande Tree, Larateras, Toku Square and the usual shopping are faithful.If you like it, it's faster to walk to Muka Wara Station than to change it honestly.Tokyu is also on board Toyoko Line and Megu.In the rumor, you can hear that the

pass!Wherever you go, it's fast. \ N But JR's Yokosuka pioneer is almost 10 minutes one way from the dogs of the naengu line or Tokyu, so it's almost a different station.There are few shops that can be shopping cheaply.You can shop for shopping.In addition, considering the transfer with the Southern Line or Toyoko Line, it is dangerous because people are biased to the north of the home.It is because of the curve, and the 10 cars of Shonan Shinjuku stop in the south.The transit passage to the Nanbu Line is made to the shortest, but considering the transfer to the Toyoko line, it is a place where you want to be in the northern end of the Yokosuka Line.It will also help you to relieve congestion.In addition, Yokosuka's pioneering ticket gate is said to be close to Mukawahara, which is the native ship.Naturally, it is not handled by transit, but the station premises are wide and difficult to understand. \ NHow about N? \ N Is it impossible to mention the reverse of the glasses of the

rush, but I don't know because I'm not a local.It is directly connected to it.I felt that the speed of the escalator from the nanfather home to the ticket gate was very fast.I think it is the fastest Kanto!Is this specification because there are many users?When you get off the escalator, your body is thrown forward because it is momentum.It will be dangerous for the elderly.Let's borrow a skin

that many users are inevitable.there is.Since it is not possible to ride in the conventional home (Sinagawa, Shinjuku), the library of the station building is also faithful and late.You can also go to Yokohama, Kawago, and Ishigami Park with Tokyo downtown and Toyoko Line.At least I think it's better than Kichi George.There are too many people who have distorted personality.It is also good to be able to take time at the window.It was quite crowded.In addition, when it is only your turn, it is said that please wait.Finally, when the replacement is over, I will give you a ticket to Narita Express.Come and scary.It may be good for women or children to be careful.Nanfish, Tokyu is far.Because the groove is curve, the train and the groove are empty.Note that you are on and off.The commuting time is severe.Unlike, it may be a huge time loss just by entering the building, so it may be good for the family, but there will be no merit to live with a single body.The real celebrity is also sold well here and is narrow compared to the Western celebrity town.It seems to be a celebrity even if I live here because I live in ancient times, rather than the ""high building"" called

On a rainy day, the line of guests waiting for a taxi bus from the east exit to the west is no longer a specialty.In particular, even though there are many users in the city, we still use small entrances to the era of construction and continue to use it.It seems to be pleasant, but it will be in this state for the time being unless it is barely denied the sense of being made on a narrow land.There are very few places where you can eat snacks such as major fast foods, such as terminal station classes, and there are no charms other than the station.Is very dangerous.The first person may be a bit embarrassed by the transfer of JR and Tokyu./ It has become easy to use in reverse, but Shinyokohama lines have long been a long -standing transfer with Tokyu Shibuya ??????I think it will continue for a while./\ N from Yokohama Line to Toyoko Line, Toyoko Line to Yokohama Line, and it has become a long and very uncomfortable station.There is an experience, but the plane has a waves that walk quickly.I can do it in other stations, but I think that \ n is longer and I can use it. \ N I appreciate it. \ NIt has been opened with an image with the same flat plaza, such as the waiting place.I think this is easy to know.There is no one before the JR Yokohama Line.And there's no charging ATM like Seven Bank, so it's really one.Besides, there are many things that have been broken.Therefore, if you are charged, it is recommended that you leave a transportation card from the case or pouch in advance./ Since there is a long business time, it is convenient to become a strange building to the groove.There is no bus terminal, but the restaurant is not as attractive as the chain store on the floor. \ N I don't know what's going on, but I don't want to ride if the Yokohama line is boring after 23:00.In transfer, even in the transfer, even if you live nearby, it is less convenient because it becomes strong every day.It is convenient to go to the wheelchair side or Shinyo Kohama because it is preferred as an elevator.However, the walking of the transfer is reformed, and the stairs are badly deployed.Local lawmakers claim that they have improved, but they are not user.JR Yokohama Line was opened in 2018 and became clean.Tokyu Toyoko Sun is dirty overall.In addition to the Tokyu Store, there is a kiosk, but the commercial facilities are weak, including the surrounding area.The development and urban plan for railway companies and local governments are weak.There is nothing, despite a vast person transfers every day.There is an advantage of using the Toyoko and Yokohama Lines nearby.JR Yokohama Line and Tokyu Toyoko Line cross the transportation and easy use.There is a Tokyu Store before the opening, and it is open from 7 am to 1 o'clock in the late night.In addition, if you walk for about 5 minutes, there are also Gohoku Library and Summit Store.I don't want to move. \ N \ n first, many things needed for life are gathered near the station.I think the nearest Olympics and Don Kihoote are huge as the same store.You can easily access Shinyokohama or Tresa Yokohama, La Lapo and Yokohama.In addition, various public facilities in Gohoku -gu are concentrated nearby (ward office, tax office, police station, Hello walk, etc.) \ n \ nIt is a benefit of Tokyu on a variety of routes, and you can only go to all places on the 23rd premises with only a transfer of the home face face of the Toyoko Line.Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Ikebukuro, one with a bankruptcy.Kamata, Meguro, Ebisu, Roppongi, Yura Kucho, Ginza, Ueno, and Oji, you can go straight to Yokohama.In the Minatomiyamoto Motochi Motochi Town, there is a route bus from Shinyo Kohama, and there is also a transfer to Keikyu in Higashikanagawa.There are many hills around, and there is a limit of land use.There is no rotary or bus platform, no sidewalks, or narrow, will be difficult for children or old people.Recently, even though it is becoming a barrier -freeization of the station and becoming easier to use, it is necessary to be organized in the future.It is crowded with high probability.In the future, I think it will be resolved if Tokyu New Yokohama can be resolved, but it is a long time.You must use Shinkansen in Shinyokohama.It is very convenient because there is a Tokyu Store or Bakery where there is a Dokyu Store or a bakery.However, it is a surrounding environment that is not thought that the position is very bad and the station is stopped.Stopping is quite annoying, so you have to stop at the station.It is inconvenient to walk out to the entrance of the JR side (western exit).Like other Tokyu stations, redevelopment around the station is a difficult environment, so I think it is difficult for the station itself to develop.It is helpful to broadcast or mark it. \ N If you don't go to the ticket gate, it's unkind and unkind. \ N \ nN Anyway, I go up the stairs and go down and get out of the elderly and the kidney.☆ \ N Reverse of the ticket window ??

\ N If you do that, I think that the station was able to improve the level of Omiya station.In particular, the JR is narrow and packed soon.The box alone, the passage is unnecessarily long and the convenience is a regret./jr Kikuna has been renewed and improved, but the convenience of history is not so good.In particular, there is no dedicated elevator from the first floor and it is very difficult to understand because it is publicly used to be publicly used for the Tokyu Store.Because \ n is not convenient. \ N The barrier -free is improved.There is no. \ NJR's transfer of the Toku Line rises and falls, which takes more time than before.Tokyu's exit, Gu Tsunashima, the order of the bus waiting for the bus, and the morning will come to the second floor.I'm not thinking about Tokyu's documentary now, and I'm sorry to see it.I didn't like the toilet, and I didn't like the toilet in the aisle, but now it's very clean and easy to use!/I stopped this station a lot.It is mainly used for public transportation purposes.I went to some shops to buy sandwiches and drinks.For fun, I took a bicycle and walked around this station.But it's not a very interesting city.However, I remember that the mansion rent was quite good compared to Yokohama and Tokyo.I think it's a good place for those who commute to Yokohama or Tokyo.For example, it would be a good place to have a wife's work in Yokohama and her husband's workplace in the center of Tokyo.There is no noise at all, so it is a good place for those who want to live the same life as tomorrow.It will not be.I think it's good ~ \ N The morning around the station is surprisingly time -raining. \ N \ N Recently, there are a lot of ramen shops around Kikuna Station.It contains famous antiques.Strictly for the elderly.There is an elevator, but you need to increase the number.It's not a design that looks at the future society/Tokyu is becoming a barrier -free, but it's not slim, but it's cold because it's not right at all./Tokyu Toyoko's station stops most of the trains.In addition, JR's Yokohama line is also on board, so it is a passenger.Do not put it in the waves of a person who changes from the Toyoko line.In addition, JR is climbing and the groove is lowered, mystery structure.Fool./ It was a simple passage station.In addition, the stairs are narrower than the passengers, and it is difficult to know the contact with the documentary.I have no choice but to expect a reverse improvement work.There is a stamp in the opening of the Tokyu Line Kikuna Station.Because most of the stations were out of the dog, the liver and care were made and cleaned, but the route was bad.The transfer of JR and Tokyu Toyoko Line is also convenient \ n. There are also stores and main lodges in front of the station, so convenient/(for JR) \ n is incredible, but the train starts earlier than the scheduled departure time (time written on the timetable timeIt may be different from.When I asked the staff, I admit it is a measure to prevent delay in other stations (!) Then I wonder what the timetable is.Why does the train do not need to arrive on time in this station?It is ridiculous to do this so that you can arrive on time to another station.Instead of telling JR's inaccurate departure time, we look forward to planning the time you need ...It was used around 11 o'clock week.It's crowded./The way back from Yokohama Arena always walks up to here.I was surprised that JR-TY's connection passage changed because it didn't visit for a long time.It's annoying because there's a lot of climbing.It will stop in the train and stop at the rapids of the Yokohama line..Tokyu Toyoko LineThe express 5050 is 8 cars and 4000 cars are 10, but the Tokyu Toyoko Line is not 10./ The JR and Toku Line are unknown while under construction.For the elderly or the body of the body, the subdivision, and the nanny cars, unkind station.It seems to be clean with the renewal in 2019. The Import Bus at the east exit of the Kikuna Station is a one -way traffic to the west exit of Tsumi Station through the old Tsunashima Gado.However, it is dangerous for the route bus to cross the Toyoko Line crossing, so it is not open and cannot be operated on time.This is because there is no plaza in front of Kikuna and cannot be done last time.In addition, the morning and evening in front of Kikuna Station is severe, and the crowds of Mt. Okura or Tsunashima can not be reversed.After the Tokyu Line and the Minato Miri Line were connected, the transfer became very convenient.It is hard to transfer at Yokohama Station./ There is no rotary place in front of the station.The bus is one of the stations that you do not want to use.It's hard to say that it was convenient after the modification?Especially in front of the station, it is really narrow and united, and inconvenient in the lane access./ It is a transfer station, so it is comfortable, but it is comfortable.You can add egg kawama toppings as a royal card, so it is beneficial.At a few o'clock, it is a crowded image./JR can be transferred. \ N The Shibusoba, which was gone in Shibuya, is located in Naka!There are also small cookers and snacks, so there's a distance from the show as if it's left alone! \ N is a wasteful place.\ n, but the groove is narrow. \ N compared to it, it is tired because many people are riding on the train. \ nThe station is big because the train doesn't stop, but it's up to there.Image) Is it only me who looks like I'm looking down at this arm?You can go straight to Yokohama, and the access to Shibuya and Tokyo is also good.Since there is a supermarket, it would be good for the belly.It is close to the Thrumi River.It's not a massage cleanliness.However, because it is 23 residents, it may feel that way.I was very surprised because the name was quite famous.At least Okurayama was good.No, it is an opinion, but it is not far from the barrier -free.But it became easy to understand.I want an exit ticket on the other side.By renewal, it was annoying because the transfer went up from the stairs and it was annoying./In front of Kikuna, many buses may not arrive in time.When the congestion is severe, it will be quite ahead of the bus stop.That's why it has become a wheelchair wings for a month./ The supermarket is connected to the station.JR Yokohama Line (JH) and Tokyu Toyoko Line (TY) are connected.There is an elevator.It is the impression that the construction is completed, and the approach to the Toyoko Line → JR has become softer than before.Full.Be careful of you, a little bit of a mess. \ N was waiting on the station stairs by the bus waiting. \ N There are just a lot of restaurants.Thank you for a long time.The station premises are clean but inconvenience has not changed ./jr, I want you to install a chair.The elderly or the bad legs were in trouble/ease of transfer evolved. \ N. \ N, I have never used it except transfer.There are a lot of morning, but it is running at a long interval.I can't understand.There is a superpherd/complex function that is being done until midnight 25:00 in the station.Line's Station/Yokohama Line and Toyoko Line are often used.It is very convenient as a terminal station at the contact of JR and Tokyu Toyoko.The transfer is also simple and convenient.It is convenient to rectify all the rectifications. \ N I want you to attach an escalator or elevator with a transfer from Yokohama Line, Toyoko Line quickly.I was using it when I went.Morning nights are quite crowded.Overall, he is too narrow/chrysanthemum.I always use crowded impressions/I use it every day.The old toilet, passage and Sayona.Even wrong!? \ N45 minutes, this is better than before/is the route better than before?Shinyokohama Mutual.Please increase the exit near Shibuya on the Toyoko Line and near Shinyokohama on the Yokohama Line./ Since it is a transit station for Tokyu and Yokohama, there are many shops around the station.Increase efficiency faster.It's annoying./ The transfer from Toyoko to JR can be softened.It is a very suitable station./There is no problem with the transfer!""Hah"" is just a centipede/Yokohama side as well as the other side of the ticket gate.JR Yokohama Line and Keikyu Toyoko Line can transfer., Too narrow \ n Waiting for Higashi Guchi Station, a large annoying new/transit station, please note that a lot of people be careful./Missing Nissan Stadium is a jam pack at the concert.Convenience because it stops.The station needs a wider platform and more exit../ Local \ n \ n buses are crowded/Tokyu Toyoko Line and JR Yokohama Line are also very difficult.The taxi platform is occupied in front of the station.I could do Shibusoba.??????…/Nothing (laughs) can be transferred with JR/once only got off at the station./Especially not/Sometimes I am taking care of it.I have been modified and wandered.I'm crowded.Gold Barrier Leaf construction?/Transit Station/Yokohama Line/Toyoko Line Terminal Station/Dong Line is inconvenient./ JR is difficult./ It is crowded./ Pretty/It's new and clean./ Very convenient./ It is easy to transfer/??…/Kikuna Hospital/Western Exit No/Transfer Convenience/Narrow Platform Roof/Convenience/Stairs Tri./ There were many people.People are rarely",559

Take a boat here to Tokyo.Walking/Taxi is too lazy to be expensive, so it's more convenient?The scenery is beautiful.5pm.…The sidewalk legs were a lot of fun around Yokohama Station.The Yokohama Station was wide vertically.The line map was easy to understand.There were many garbage that Poisburban was outside the station.We are always working.Is it over?It feels like.It is inconvenient to pass through the station.The number of routes is not caught in Tokyo or Shinjuku, but the number of boarding railways is Japan's first role./ If you see Sunrise Izumo stopping, it feels a bit lucky.If you look at this, I remember the scenery of the wind from the car window.The platform has a large level of Tokyo station. \ N \ n is still late.!! \ n \ n, but I only use this station twice a year. \ n \ n I was very worried that there was no home door. \ n \ nI thought it was good. \ N \ n Narita Express is also very convenient.This Yokohama Station says, “It is best to listen if you do not know \ n because you are faithful to the guide facilities and \ n if you ask the road.If you go to the inside of N, there is a place to prohibit access, but why don't you go to you because I think it's enough to enjoy the atmosphere? \ nI think it is easier to transfer than Odawara to transfer to the subway and Sotetsu in the subway.The station is renewed and clean and convenient.JRs (Tokaido, Negishi, Yokohama, Yokosuka), Kei Hin Express, Tokyu Toyoko, Sagami Railway, and Subway are included.You cannot transfer.Therefore, it is recommended that the transfer time is not possible because the succession time changes without grasping each platform.And if you don't have a transportation IC card, it's annoying to buy a ticket with JR and Keikyu.Is good with a sophisticated feeling.It takes time to identify the exit and the crowd can be overwhelming.However, it is good to connect with shopping malls and many restaurants.Breurite Yokohama ~ ????Strange love is ~ In the Machadang ~ ??, etc. (there are a lot of songs!It is often used because of this, but Yokohama Station has a charm that is not tired. \ N \ n There is a newcoman in the station building. \ N \ nIn the old days, the girl who was wearing a red shoes was that the statue was famous for being in Yamashita Park?I couldn't help it because I couldn't take it to Nantes, so I stroked my chest with a different heart ?? \ n \) But Yokohama is called Yokohama ?? \ n.. \ N \ n Jajaja?It was more likely to get lost.
