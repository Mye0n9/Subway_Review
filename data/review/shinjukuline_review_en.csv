Odaku's ticket gate.There are so many enough to not be bumped into people or care.Indeed, the station with the highest number of users in Japan.Recently, there was a passage to connect the east exit and the west exit, making it very convenient.Transfer train full of trains.It's a good thing, but thanks to that, people are always caught if they stay for a long time.There's a lot of coin locks and toilets. If you want to go to Kabuki -cho, you can find a shop without information. Find a shop with a shop.There are many men and foreigners recruiting guests on the side of the road.It is better not to go.I've done it many times.This time it was okay, but I don't know when it will happen.So I suggest not to believe in a man who drives guests on the side of the road.Even if I did before, I have succeeded many times in a way of gathering guests on the side of the road.But today I was cheated by 24,500 yen because I gathered guests on the roadside. The degree of technique and intimidation still surprised me.Everyone knows that the underground world of Japan is legal and the police will not interfere.There are advantages and disadvantages, but honestly, I hope it will be clearly translated so that Japanese people can understand.This time, the price is just a little cheaper than others.I am a customer who can compare the price.If the price is much lower than the normal price, you will understand that there is a problem.I can no longer say because I know that Japanese people are very smart.This time, I was recruiting guests from the roadside, and the person who recruited guests from the side first told me what I needed, and asked me about the regulations, and there was no regulation at all.Before I came to Kabuki -cho, I knew that there were a lot of regulations in the Japanese world, and I was told that people who did not keep them were cut off.So I always ask first and check many times so that everything is clear.I took me to the hotel and paid for it.The room was charged 13,000 yen first and the hotel fee was 1,500 yen.He told me to check it again and down several times from downstairs.The hotel has opened a new room.There was no big problem at the counter and it was very smooth.In the room, he told me to call the girl and call the girl before he claimed 13,000 yen.Of course, he confirmed that the total price is 14,500 yen and the hotel is 1,500.He charged 13,000 yen and called the woman, and she arrived in less than five minutes.As soon as I put down the bag outside the door to go to the bathroom, she came in and asked where.The person who introduced me downstairs also knew the terrain of the hotel, and as soon as I entered the hotel, he introduced the overall layout of the hotel.When I went to the bathroom and entered the room, she asked me to take a shower first, and my stuff was outside, but I asked if I would like to take a shower together.The girl refused.I respected the opinions of the girls and went to take a shower alone.I took a shower quickly because the things would be stolen, and the girl said that it couldn't be for me.He told me to wear clothes and asked what kind of service he wanted., I said in advance, so I don't have to claim anymore.The cheapest plan for women was 30,000 won, which is more expensive.The money he gave to the introduction was not counted at all. The person was too high. The salary was so high that he didn't leave it anyway.It is possible to cancel.I pointed my body and said, ""I took off my clothes. How do you cancel?""Anyway, I asked a few times and I couldn't cancel it for free.The cancellation fee is at least 10,000 yen.Refuses to wear clothes.The lowest plan is massaged for 30,000 yen.In the end, he canceled without saying anything and refused to use money.Please let me go anyway.Eventually, he originally used an additional 10,000 yen for 14,500 yen, and the girl left without anything.If you are going to the custom shop, you can go to the ""Information Store"" to accept it even if you cancel it after considering.But the risk of recommending guests on the side of the road is very high.The price of ""drink and putting"" is not very high, and it does not threaten to take clothes or things.Personally, whether or not to report it to the police, it is your problem that Japanese police gangsters are allowed, customized shops are allowed, and custom stores and gangs are not allowed to say that there is a problem.There is a problem if a gang is a problem.If there is a problem, there will be no evidence, otherwise the gangsters of the world will be protected.Keep looking for someone to retaliate.Anyway, it's all legal.The whole Japanese society is not trying to solve the problem.The environment is cleaner and less garbage. If you go deep into Japan, you will understand. You haven't experienced this pain, so if you see this, I know you want to laugh at it.There is nothing I can do and I'm helpless.If you meet me someday, you will understand.If you want something else rather than ""drinking and attaching the title,"" go to the milk case office.I can't win.Please keep these illegal and non -shoppers from surviving ~~ Please make Japan better in this field.Why are there more more ""foreign"" beggars in Japan's streets?His present may be our future.Oh, but I don't want to swear, but I will surely be retaliated.I dare to say that you deceived many foreigners and they all paid normally. Why do I put off so much?If everyone wants to open your wounds, if everyone is so compromised and afraid of shame, will there be more people who are deceived?? Shinjuku Grand Terminal is waiting for the idea of the idea of the New Juku Grand Terminal!Each construction is in progress at the west exit.The old Odaku department store is being dismantled, and the building is gradually decreasing, such as red trash.This is unbelievable that in 2029, it will be a building (260m above ground, 48 floors) than the eavesdropping.Can you also rebuild Keio and JR in stages, so you can go through the Hashimi free passage that connects the east and west?It is expected that the railway station Shinjuku, which boasts the largest number of users in the world, is expected.Do you want to observe regularly ??/I was an American under the average IQ and I was surprised to see how easy it was to go around from the station!The staff were great and answered all questions and were very kind.There are many shops, restaurants, and vending machines in the station, making it much more enjoyable!In fact, everything is clear, intuitive and easy.Despite the number of unrealistic people. \ N and another unrealistic thing about the number of people is that the station is cleaner than my living room./It is the role of the world's best user as well as Japan.Many people are coming and going all day. \ N It is also a labyrinth that is a very large station where many JR lines and the railroads are boarded./ The largest terminal station in Korea.The Nehwari is the north, the south, the south, and the eavesdropping.There is a smoking in the Juo Line Express Home./ (hereinafter referred to as BARD).).It is located in the center of Shinjuku Docturnal City, and the number of lifts is the world's world's world's world record. \ N2023/11/09/Shinjuku Station \There are many home appliances stores in the area in front of the station. \ N \We arrived on a day rather than a holiday, but there were still many people. \ N \ n Dinner at Kabuki -cho, the representative attraction of Shinjuku, and enjoy meals (shabu -shabu) at Momo Kabuki focal. \ NIt is not recommended to stay here late at night because you can see garbage. \ N We arrived during the day and we saw the parade.I endured ~ \ n So far, when I go to the shooting for lunch, I have suffered from the combination of the light of the sun or the construction of the surrounding area, but the CM or public advertisement flowed more cleanly.Collaboration was also difficult ~ Another wonderful train station in Japan.You can easily find a platform to ride the train.Employees of the Guide Desk are very good at English and can help you buy tickets.Perhaps the most crowded station in the world.Many JR lines pass through Shinjuku.You can ride a lot of trains to Fuji, especially to Kawaguichiko Station (Fuji Train).There are many shopping shops inside for a good price.I only think about it/traffic here is very convenient.Each type of vehicle has a clear ride.I first came to ask the official for help to buy a ticket.It is convenient because Naruki Ishii and Quiokuniya are located adjacent to Fuji Mountain Travel/Station.It is interesting to have a very different atmosphere in front of the station in the east, south and south of the station, like a huge terminal station.On the road of Basta, there were 5 trillion trillions of roads despite Monday.It feels like a street that doesn't fall asleep at night.Keio's home is called Shinseon Shinjuku Station, so it is different for some reason.The subway station, which is directly connected to the city deep into the city, is nearby. \ N This is already a frequent visit to Tokyo, so everything you need is already equipped while changing in the volcano.Thank you?The redevelopment plan is in progress, and I can't improve my life.Even after the end of the end, I have never seen an adult and a time when people are completely eliminated. \ NThe inside is a maze, so there is a lot of distance from the west to the east, and the person of the first person is lost.Therefore, I recommend that you come to the ground once you are not confident.As a result of comparing information on various means of transportation, the way back was to choose Mt.

Since it was not allowed to return from the outside to return to the area from Honhachi only, the suica enters the opening without a history of entering the Suica (interphone.Beyond the situation, I am allowed by the station and get permission from the station.) \ N??Even if you check it a few times, you can say, ""It's good to ride.""Which ticket gate do you want to come out? ”There is also a person's eyes.Take it to, “Please put the entrance history and put a suica.” \ N \ N After all, the entry history was attached. \ N The exchange of that time is wasteful. \ N I don't apologize until the last end. \ NIt was a mood. \ Nway, the reverse that I wanted.On the other side is the role of Kei Sey Sun.It was a Shinjuku ship to meet with the new vehicle of the Asakusa Line./I was about two years ago, but since I responded severely to the station in the ticket gate of this station, JR has not been used since then. \ NI think there's no more, but I'm still moving to the bus or subway.There are also many scrambled intersections, so there are quite a lot of people.Previously, Oba, who was kind in front of the station, was open to the octopus of the octopus, so it was delicious to buy it.It is also called the birthplace of the father's cutting!I hear that Koreans are also crying. \ N \ n ※ If you are walking through Honhachi Bay, you are singing Bon Jovi's nose and bumping in front of the station.You can walk while singing the hum, you can't understand his own muscle.Sei, Doei Shinjuku, and JR are convenient \ n because the north exit is originally a manehore, there are many rich people in large houses, and the south exit is emerging residential area, so there are many general layers, the shops are expensive, and the options are all cheap.It's easy to live.The rapid train does not stop, but the station can transfer Keise Line or Doei Shinjuku Line.It is convenient to live and shop.There is also a shuttle bus from the north exit to Nikke Colton Plaza.//Jr and Keise's end of the Doei Shinjuku Line, which is very common, but it's a bit worried in terms of security.There are quite a lot of shops in the reversal, and there are some lucky ramen shops.N1 November 21st (Sun) At 18:00, let's push the recommended candidate's illness (^-^) // JR, Doei Shinjuku Line, and Keissey (Keisei Hachiman Station) are boarding.The north exit and the south entrance are all flights of many bus routes at the starting station of the bus.Village festival at the south exit, village festival at the north exit.Each of them was crowded all day, and it was a pretty unique station. \ N Is there a poster of Mr. Jaguar?There are two types of 」.In comparison with the neighboring station Ichikawa, the over there is a rapid, but Ichikawa's administration is gathered here, and the busy commercial facilities are all over.It's a terminal.Welcome to the poster of the station!Excuse me, but I laughed.Sorry not to get wet.You can shop with a transportation IC card (Suica · PASMO).Doei traffic free tickets and silver passes can also come here.Unpleasant because the reverse is frustrated.Sorry for the tyranny.Increasing Japan 2nd/toilet is also clean, so the station building is too small and easy to use.I think there are many good bars because there are Keisei, JR, Doei and 3 lines.Use/reverse response is bad ./ Yankees/Pretty!/☆☆☆☆",462
