0,0,Pelham Bay Park station,4.2,"The last station of Uptown 6.There is an overpass directly connected to Pelham Bay Park.This station has an elevator, which does not work dirty and always.There is a Dunkin donut across the street and a magazine at the bottom of the train station.This train station was always dirty.The good thing is that you don't wait for a train to the city for a long time.To avoid confusion, you need to change the name of this location. \ N \ N originally tried to reduce this grade to 5 points.Already cleaning! \ N \ n This is a review of the station.Very good.However, I needed a citibike dock. \ N \ n was impressive that the emergency gate worked with a card.Good touch.I always use it when I have a bicycle. \ N \ n my review tends to be a bicycle center.I don't have a car, but I will borrow my car on vacation.If this perspective is interested in you.You may want to follow my review.There is no keyword for a bicycle or bicycle on the Google map.Why is it that?There is a nice small dog park and a great run track, so people passing by must check.Parking/Upgrade has been wider.There are more spaces to wander and control.The bus stop is more distributed to reduce congestion.But I no longer live in New York City.Still, every time I visit Bronx, I always come here!This is the best place to walk, bicycle, run or picnic.A wonderful atmosphere and a wonderful package.There are a few bums who always seem to be there.There is also a religious non -mainstream group that distributes leaflets.I have lived here for 20 years, and Pelham Bay MTA employees do nothing to improve their services or attitudes.They know they are police!Clerk (not police) does nothing, but I think I will receive a lot of salary.The vacuum cleaner is not cleaned!They came out of the government program, certainly not education, and not suitable for providing food to people on the train. \ N \No one is always dirty.It is filled with crazy homeless people who do not say that they are the last stop to get off the train.Don't pay the cost!So be careful!The seat is dirty!Unless they say dirty, they will not clean and even stand and even work as if they are your job.The deputy is always late except for some!Even on the weekend, even riding a train completely blocks it!It's the only way we arrive in the city, so it's like a terrible nightmare we need to ride.This station has a lovely subway car theme entrance.When I was there, a pigeon climbed in my car, quietly commuting Jerre as Zerega Avenue, where he politely.I like MTA./ I always had a good time

park is good, but don't come at night.When I went last time, many people wore clothes, covered their bodies with black cloth, similar to KKK, but they wore black clothes, wearing pointed hats, and what they were doing.If you ask me, it's not that safe.It's not cool.There is no illustration or it looks new.But on the ground (when you go in, you can see how the neighborhood looks), and there is an Indian bridge connected to the park across the street, so you do not have to cross the busy distance below.Buses stop here.Then, it's a good station.And train No. 6 is the only train to come here

friendly.I hope you will peel off all the paints that cause the iron plate to peel off.The window inside the elevator is a bit dirty but the floor is clean.There is a newspaper plane outside.There is a pretty clean bathroom.I have a stained glass.The night looks good/considering how busy it is, it works surprisingly well.To be honest, most of my problems are about MTA.The biggest problem is that it is constantly terminated and there is no other reasonable option./ In a good location, all buses 50, 5, 12 or 12, 23, etc. can be moved to Uptown and downtown.Shopping is a good area CVS offers friendly employees such as fresh, cold drinks, warm or cold pastry on Dunkin donuts.The doctor's office dermatologist, Bottegas, has a really delicious and inexpensive bacon cheese and eggs.It is well stored.There is one problem.vampire.Once I saw a friend biting an old lady.It's really terrible!Except for night vampires, it is a good station to ride the train./ Clean the terminal.There are

35,35,Bleecker Street station,4.1,"The mosaic tiles of all IRT stations were manufactured in American Encaustic Tile Company, which contracted each station installation.The decorative work was performed by the FAIENCE contractor Grueby FAIENCE COMPANY.The station is similar to all stations around the city.It looks like an uninhabited.Or at least when we were there.To find the entrance, you must be on the right side of the road.Like all stations, you can use the right air and signs to make the stop more clearly.Every time I go into the wrong direction, I have to go through a series of tunnels to reach the right platform.Please add it again!It's so frustrating…/New York subway has its own personality.It's a bit warm in summer, but that warmth is so good in winter.It is a good way to prevent wet when heavy rain comes.Finally, you can transfer between (b) (D) (f) (m) and (6) in both directions.In addition, a fantastic art work was also installed.The service of (6) is mostly satisfactory.It is soaked in this place where the fragrance of urine and feces and the fragrance of new milk are intertwined.Now it has become a major subway hub.You can move to B/D/F/M via the stairs and the elevator.The exit is in Laffayette and Crosby Street.5 stars/Elevator in NE Corner of Houston and Crosby/This is a great area, and the subway station is enough for 6 people./ Good place to stay/today's exceptional train delayed ..

38,38,Brooklyn Bridge­City Hall,4.3,"New York City Hall Subway Station.There's nothing special, and it's a good idea to get off here to cross the Brooklyn Bridge from Manhattan.My favorite train is the R142A subway with the JESSCIA advertisement.I hope that the MTA will record this fact and re -publish the original announcement in the Lexington Avenue Line, which started NYC and all human life in the city.As an African -American, it is worth $ 2.90 for subway fare, so pay the fee.Because it provides value.If you go to other states, there is no transportation.Or maybe I'm always looking at 777, or it's just lucky.I liked this place!It is easy to walk from Brooklyn to New York, and the subway can be easily reached nearby.The view is really cool!Everyone must take this walk!/It's a big train station for those who want to go to Brooklyn Bridge, but it's more suitable for locals who have to go to the shopping area.Either way, it's a train station that doesn't work more than moving from one place to another.It is recommended to take the tennis because the promenade is long.It is a street.For example, a group of elephants pass by to prove that it is reliable and not fraud.It was created before the existence of a car.You must remember that there is a bicycle path (respect it and the bike passes at full force).Even if the lock is visible, it cannot be left, a fine is imposed, and the lock is very likely to be lost the next day.It is easy to cross the bridge or take the subway to Manhattan.no see.There is a faded magnificence.If you stay on the subway, you can see when it will change from downtown to uptown.Do not be afraid of leaving all passengers.It is embarrassing that the bottom line is not so magnificent.It is functional but nothing special.It is very convenient to maintain a better sign for the exit and the beautiful tiles that have seen a better time (a few years ago).I took a taxi before, but the driver was lost in the wrong position.The subway saves our lives and taxis are very expensive.I want to go back to Manhattan later.It's much more convenient than Staton Island.It usually runs on time/I was in Brooklyn to see my sister, it was a great day.It was crowded with people, but it did not reduce my great experience.I recommend visiting this symbolic place and keeping it clean, and I believe it is forbidden to put a lock on the leg fence.Everything seems to be fine.Brooklyn's beautiful panoramic..It is recommended to walk in the direction of the Brooklyn Bridge downtown by the subway.It was built in 1909.It is natural without modern tools.It would have been adversity.Beautiful building.The interior is empty.Line 4 and Line 6 are running under it.They no longer build these buildings.This place is convenient to go anywhere.The World Trade is about 5-6 blocks from Chinatown and Little Italy./ The City Hall Loop, which was opened in 1104, was once a luxurious terminal station used by about 600 passengers a day.Passenger trips through this station have been suspended after 40 years due to the rapid increase in the New York population.Today you can visit the station only at a very specific time of a year.At one time, it was a popular spot where locals and travelers could see the complex designs of the past, but they were closed in the mid -20th century.In addition, all trains on Line 6 form the end of this place, and the direction is changed to the opposite direction.But what most people don't know is that if Line 6 continues to ride, the track passes through the old and abandoned city hall.It is very interesting but not much to see the lights of the train rarely shine the old platform, and the light upstairs is coming through the stairs that go up to the city hall.It's very fun to see, but it's not very good to take a picture./If you take train 6, which is the last station, keep boarding the train.why?You can meet beautiful and historical viewing.I think it was closed in the 20s.If you pass it, train 6 will appear again on the uptown platform.The new station is beautiful.I like the iron cable around the entrance of the city hall, but keep the interval in mind when getting on the train and getting off.The station is a bit bent./I highly recommend it to see the clean and old city hall stop after the train of Line 6 continued to ride around.It's just changing the direction, and you can get off at the station in the north direction.Climbing the stairs is full of noisy atmosphere.The park had a great crowd and performers who are doing all kinds of acts.The choices to go and the direction to go are somewhat overwhelming, but the stairs were the first step of the journey across the Brooklyn Bridge.If you are going to travel, please prepare.If the weather is good, there will be a lot of people who take a walk. \ N If you go back to the review you looked forward, this station has a lot of lines to go anywhere.Make sure you downloaded the app so you can see which train to take.I was going to the wrong road several times before I found the app!If you visit Brooklyn Bridge (1 minute walk), Wall Street or World Trade Center (10-15 minutes walk), the location is really convenient.And if you also visit the Grand Central Terminal, you can take a minimum of 15 minutes by riding the express train 4 or 5 times here.You can keep staying while returning, and you can get a glimpse of the beautiful and abandoned city hall.Many people seem to have done this without any consequences.But if I was caught, I read that the MTA could impose a fine of $ 50 or more.If you want to have a good tour, you can check the ticket at the New York Transportation Museum, which is usually difficult to get a ticket because the ticket is sold out quickly without a tour.This station is accessible to wheelchairs and provides mobile phone services and free Wi-Fi.There is also a departure sign that tells you when the train will come.If you stay in Line 6, which has been on the end, you can get a glimpse of the ruined city hall station.Travel! \ N \ n. Our guide was very well aware of the history of the area and had a passion for architecture.This was actually added to the tour.My only problem is that NYTM does not tell me in advance that audio equipment is used on the tour.(I'm not a deaf, but I have a little bit of difficulty in the sound of a particular type. There was a lot more like a tour.). \ n \ N70 years have not been used for the damage, but this station is really worth seeing and taking pictures.When train 6 turns south to south, it looks like a light inside the tunnel.In addition, the exchange point from 6 to 4 or 5 is located directly across the track.Tourist spots can be found on foot. \ N \ N local residents are playing music and you can taste good street foods.You can walk, drive, take pictures, buy souvenirs, smoke, eat something, look around, and see the scenery.It's almost basic.But you do it on your legs.So it's a leg.It's long.I think.I'm not sure about it.Let's check Wikipedia.Anyone can walk across the legs or ride a bicycle ./ Good old buildings/homeless people and shaded people.It was built between 1870 and 1883, and at the time of its opening, the world's largest suspension bridge (1825m long, 486.3m between columns).The bridge is built with a maximum length of 521m.It was also the first work to hang on a steel cable.Since then, it has become one of the most well -known symbols of New York.If you take a train on Line 6, you can see it out of the window.They are currently organizing a tour./Very convenient and useful, but the J platform is too old./This leg is amazing!Defo recommends walking across from NYC's beautiful views./ Relatively clean and convenient location near Brooklyn Bridge.Free Wi-Fi is an additional bonus from all subway stations./ The exit to a good/municipal building was designed by Spanish architect F Guastavino who built central station.The magnificent safe/bizarre/great view, easy to walk.Just go to the left.The bikers are fast./Be careful in summer.In this station, you can do Cook U Alive and will do that.It is normal to work like an oven.It's a great/really beautiful building/Art Works \ N Hugh Bridge \Functional, but some modifications may be required.I like this station very much.I want you to connect this station with the R line.It is worth visiting./Beautiful view on the east side of Manhattan Skyline/I'm just here to take an amazing (R) train here ....It's old and I don't like the station and tunnel very much.But it's not good.The service was okay, but it was all over the place ./ One of the most beautiful bridges in New York. \ N When I visit New York, I like New York/I like New York/I stop by before visiting Brooklyn Bridge.I think it's new/everything is very good and systematic/very convenient location.Good!/Brooklyn Bridge, enjoy the city's wonderful views/a good place for the New Year's celebration.It is always fun to enjoy the scenery/knowing the city of New York.Many/Very beautiful and attractive place/Good experience/Here I love night time/huge !!The world's most beautiful bridge/Brooklyn bridge walking distance ../Not a real hall/Mainly a court building, government/very cool !!Okay, I know/People talk about foreigners/Brooklyn legs.City Hall./ Red/Likes/Classic Architecture./Beautiful place !!!/Check it/New York experience/??…/Cool/@gone_muching/???????????/Secret Station/It's a pretty big subway station under the city hall.Impressive Building !!/Thank you for your time and energy.Children -friendly environment.Pet -friendly environment.Wheelchairs are available./We are transferring in downtown Manhattan.I really liked the walk from Brooklyn Bridge City Hall to Bridge.I have been able to visualize various film shooting so far and enjoyed reading the amazing history of how it was made.The courage of Emily Warren Roebling was really noteworthy.You must visit!As soon as we follow the flow of human, we arrive at the shore of the Brooklyn Bridge.The way back from the Brooklyn Bridge can return to Manhattan from High S or York St./ There is no toilet in a clean bathroom.There is no soap in the partition and there is no lock, so you can't draw a more wonderful picture in the women's bathroom.The elevator is cleaner/Brooklyn Bridge City Hall Train Station is located downstairs.If you use the Express 4, 5, and Region 6, you can move to the entrance of Brooklyn Bridge.",282
